<h4>Types of Instalment Plans</h4>
<p>There are generally two types of instalment plans:</p>
<p><strong>In-house Instalment Payment Plan</strong> - The store offers to
extend credit to the customer. In these plans, the store can usually repossess
the item should the customer fail to pay their instalments.</p>
<p><strong>Instalment Payment Plan offered by a credit card company</strong> -
Credit is offered as a deal between a credit card issuer and a merchant
as an incentive for customers to use that credit card. <strong>Here's how they compare:</strong>

<p>Let's look at these two types of plans in-depth.</p>
<h4>In-house Instalment Payment Plans</h4>
<p>For in-house plans, merchants typically charge a flat interest rate of
11% to 27% for a repayment period of up to 72 months. Plans can be offered
even for small purchases.</p>
<h5>Take note: the cost is much higher than it seems!</h5>
<p>Even though you are only paying a small instalment each month, the final
cost of the item is much higher after taking the interest into account.
**</p>
<p>For example, suppose you walk into a store and see a 65-inch Ultra HD
4K TV marked down from $6,500 to $5,200. That's 20% off the original price.
It's still a big amount. So, the salesperson offers you an instalment plan
of just <strong>$44.90 per week</strong>, over 48 months.</p>
<p>Seems like a good deal? Let's do the math:</p>
<p>What you pay per month: $44.90 x 4 = $179.60 Total paid after 48 months:
$8,620.80 Total interest paid (on sale price of $5,200): $3,420.80</p>
<p>After 48 months, that TV will end up costing you <strong>$8,620.80</strong>.
That is almost 66% more than the sale price of $5,200 and almost 33% more
than the original price of $6,500.</p>
<p>In some cases, the interest you pay could end up being more than the purchase
price itself!</p>
<h4>Zero-interest instalment payment plans</h4>
<p>Interest-free instalment plans offered by credit card companies allow
you to pay the same price as someone who pays the whole sum upfront in
cash â€“ but only if you pay the instalment in full and on time.</p>
<h4>Take note: your obligation is to the bank</h4>
<p>With an instalment plan, your payment obligation is to the credit card
issuer, not the merchant. Once you charge something to your credit card,
you have to settle the charge fully.</p>
<p>This means:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You will need to keep paying the monthly instalments even if the merchant
winds up</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Although the instalment plan itself is interest-free, if you miss a payment,
you will incur credit card interest charges</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You may not be able to cancel the card until you make all the payments</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Refunds or exchanges may not be allowed once the bank approves the instalment
plan</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You may have to pay a penalty fee if you decide to opt out of the monthly
instalment plan and repay it sooner</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The unpaid portion of the instalment is counted as a debt in your name</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>The bottom line</h4>
<p>That deceptively low monthly payment may end up costing you much more
in the long run. So consider saving up for a purchase, instead of taking
on an instalment plan.</p>
<p>If you are already on an instalment plan, think carefully before committing
to another one. The overlapping instalment payments can quickly add up
and hit your monthly cash flow.</p>
