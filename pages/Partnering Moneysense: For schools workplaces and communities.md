Partnering MoneySense: for schools, workplaces and communities

MoneySense invites you to partner us to bring financial literacy education to various segments of the population.

Find out how we can work together to help consumers acquire the knowledge and skills to manage their finances, make prudent financial decisions, and plan for their longer term needs.  

### Talks for employees and community groups

The MoneySense–Singapore Polytechnic Institute for Financial Literacy (IFL) offers free talks and workshops on basic money management, financial planning, and personal investing.

The institute can also conduct free talks or workshops at your premises.

For more information on the talks and workshops, you can visit the [IFL website](https://ifl.org.sg/).  

If you're interested in arranging for a talk or workshops, you may get in touch with IFL via the "Contact Us" form on the [IFL website](https://ifl.org.sg/).
