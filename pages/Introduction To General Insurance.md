<h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Make sure you know what's covered and what's not</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Know who can sell you general insurance</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You'll receive a lump sum if the item covered is lost or damaged</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>General insurance is designed to protect the things you value. Your insurance
company will pay you the sum assured or an agreed amount to cover some
or all the loss under certain situations.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Loss of your belongings when you travel</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Damage to your car</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Damage to your house</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Who Are You Dealing With</h3>
<p>General insurance products may be sold by general insurance agents or
broking staff of insurance brokers. Before acting as an insurance agent
for distributing general insurance products, the person or company must
register with the Agents Registration Board (ARB), which is under the General
Insurance Association (GIA) of Singapore.</p>
<p>Before buying, ask for the agentâ€™s GIA number. Check with the ARB to see
if the individual is permitted to sell general insurance products.</p>
<p>Under the General Insurance Code of Practice, general insurers and their
agents have to explain all the main features of their products and services.
They are also expected to handle your claims, complaints and requests for
information fairly and promptly.</p>
<h3>Policy Owners' Protection (PPF)</h3>
<p>Did you know that in Singapore, there is protection for your insurance
policies? The PPF Scheme covers general insurance policies including all
compulsory insurance policies under the Motor Vehicles (Third Party Risks
and Compensation) Act, Work Injury Compensation Act, short term accident
and health (A&amp;H) policies and specific policies issued to individuals
such as:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Personal motor insurance policies</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Personal travel insurance policies</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Personal property (structure and contents) insurance policies</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Foreign domestic maid insurance policies</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These specific policies insure risks arising in Singapore or where the
insured is a Singapore resident or has a permanent establishment in Singapore.</p>
<p>In the event of the failure of a general insurer, Singapore Deposit Insurance
Corporation (SDIC)&nbsp;will compensate policy owners for claims incurred
up to 30 days after the winding up order. SDIC will also refund policy
owners the pro-rated premiums paid for the unutilised period of insurance
coverage. This is to enable policy owners to seek alternative coverage
from other general insurers.</p>
