<h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>When you buy a traded life policy (TLP) or traded endowment policy (TEP),
you pay the policy premiums until the policy matures or until the death
of the life insured</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The maturity date of your investment may be uncertain</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>MAS does not regulate intermediaries nor distributors of TLPs and TEPs</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>What are TLPs and TEPs?</h3>
<p>A traded life policy (TLP) is a life policy that has been sold by the
original policy owner to an investor other than the insurer.</p>
<p>In the case of a traded endowment policy (TEP), it is an endowment policy
that has been sold by the original policy owner to an investor other than
the insurer. TLPs and TEPs are commonly known as "second-hand" policies.</p>
<h3>What happens in a sale</h3>
<p>When a policyholder decides to liquidate his life policy or endowment
policy, he may do so via an individual or company that wants to buy the
policy for resale. Such an intermediary usually offers to buy the policy
at a price higher than the policy’s surrender value offered by the insurer.
The intermediary may then re-sell the policy to another investor.</p>
<p>Throughout the process, only existing policies purchased from the original
policyholders are involved. No new life or endowment policy is created.</p>
<p>Both the ownership and benefits of the policy are transferred from the
original policy owner to the investor upon sale. However, the original
life insured remains unchanged. The obligation of paying the policy premium
is transferred either to the investor or an intermediary who has purchased
and is holding on to the policies with the intention of re-selling them
to a further investor.</p>
<p>This obligation will continue until the policy matures for TEPs or till
the insured passes on in the case of TLPs.</p>
<p><strong>Key learning point</strong>: Remember that if you buy a TLP or
TEP, you are obligated to pay the policy premiums until the policy matures
or the insured passes on. The maturity date of your investment may be uncertain.</p>
<h3>Are TLPs and TEPs regulated by MAS?</h3>
<p>MAS does not regulate the sale, purchase, or distribution of TLPs and
TEPs. This means that any individual or company involved in buying or distributing
these policies is not regulated or licensed by MAS.</p>
<p>Currently, registered life insurers in Singapore do not buy policies from
policyholders for resale, and do not distribute TLPs and TEPs. The TLPs
and TEPs being sold in Singapore could either be policies originating from
local insurers or policies bought from other countries.</p>
<p><strong>Key learning point:</strong> Remember that neither the intermediary
nor the distributor of a TLP or TEP is regulated by MAS.</p>

<h3>Implications for investors</h3>
<p>Investors who buy TLPs and TEPs cannot rely on laws administered by MAS
to take action against either the intermediary who re-sold or packaged
the policies or the distributor of the policies should they encounter any
problems with the investment process.</p>
<p>A TLP or TEP investor must pay the policy premiums just as if he were
the original policy owner. In turn, the insurance company must pay out
the benefits based on the terms in the policy contract to the investor
when the policy matures or the insured passes on.
<br>
<br>The obligations of the intermediary towards the investor are set out in
the contract when the TLP or TEP is purchased. Investors should read all
the terms and conditions of any contractual document, and make sure they
understand the legal implications of entering into any agreement. Investors
should not buy the TLP or TEP if they are uncertain about the terms or
implications of the contract.</p>
<p>Investors can, nevertheless, seek recourse under the <a href="https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/CPFTA2003" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Act (CPFTA)</a>.
The CPFTA allows consumers aggrieved by unfair practices to pursue civil
remedies before the courts.</p>
<p><strong>Key learning point:</strong> Make sure you read and understand
all the terms and conditions before you sign anything. Ask questions if
there is anything that you do not understand.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>MAS strongly encourages investors to deal only
with individuals and companies that are regulated by MAS.</p>

<p>TLPs and TEPs have the following risks:</p>
