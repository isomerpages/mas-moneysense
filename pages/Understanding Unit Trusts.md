<h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>When you buy into unit trusts, your investments are handled by a fund
manager</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The returns on your investment are dependent on many factors, including
your risk appetite and the fees charged to the investor and the fund</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The list of funds authorised or recognised by MAS for sale to retail investors
is available on OPERA</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you invest in a unit trust or fund, your money is pooled with money
from other investors and invested in a portfolio of assets according to
the fund’s stated investment objective and investment approach.</p>
<p>A unit trust is a fund which adopts a trust structure; not all funds use
a trust structure. In this guide, the term “fund” will also refer to a
unit trust.</p>
<h3>Unit Trusts Versus Investment-linked Policies (ILPs)</h3>
<p>Investment-linked Insurance Policies (ILPs) are another way to invest
in funds. The difference between these and unit trusts is that ILPs combine
life insurance coverage and investment components. Your premiums are used
to pay for units in sub-funds of your choice, and some of the units are
then sold to pay for insurance and other charges.</p>
<p>If your main goal is investment, you may wish to consider unit trusts.
Sometimes, the ILP sub-fund that you are interested in may also be offered
as a unit trust (i.e. without insurance coverage).</p>
<h3>How It Works</h3>
<p>In Singapore, local and foreign funds offered to retail investors are
regulated as collective investment schemes. A fund manager manages the
unit trust or fund. They are paid a management fee from the fund, typically
based on a percentage of the assets they manage.</p>
<h3>Returns From Unit Trusts</h3>
<p>You invest in a fund by buying units in the fund. There is a capital gain
when the price of the units rises above the price you paid for the fund.
Some funds pay dividends.</p>
<p>The price of each unit is based on the fund’s net asset value (NAV) divided
by the number of units outstanding. The NAV of a fund is the market value
of the fund’s net assets (investments, cash and other assets minus expenses,
payables and other liabilities.) The NAV is usually computed daily to reflect
changes in the prices of the investments held by the fund.</p>
<h3>What Is The Most You Can Lose?</h3>
<p><strong>Funds are not principal or capital-guaranteed.</strong>&nbsp;You
may lose a substantial amount of the money you invested in certain situations.
The risks of investing in the fund are described in the product offering
documents such as the prospectus and the product highlights sheet.</p>
<p><strong>Fees can also reduce your returns.</strong>&nbsp;Fees are usually
payable regardless of how well or poorly the fund performs. Even if your
fund’s value has been fairly stable, the fees you pay will, over time,
reduce the value of your investment.</p>
<h3>Why Invest In Funds?</h3>
<p>Funds invest in a diversified range of assets. A fund’s diversified portfolio
means risks can be better spread over the assets in the fund.</p>
<h3>What Are The Risks?</h3>
<p>Some of the risks associated with investing in unit trusts include the
following:</p>

</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p><strong>Market risk</strong>
</p>
</td>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>The fund’s NAV or trading prices will be affected by changes in the value
of the assets in the fund that in turn are affected by changing economic,
political or market conditions.</p>
</td>

<p><strong>Liquidity risk</strong>
</p>
</td>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>There is no secondary market for funds that are not listed. Hence, you
can only redeem your units on the fund’s dealing days.</p>
<p>The secondary market may also be illiquid for funds that are listed and
traded on a securities exchange. This may affect the prices at which you
buy or sell.</p>
</td>

<tr>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p><strong>Interest rate risk</strong>
</p>
</td>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>Funds that invest in bonds, debentures or other debt securities will be
exposed to interest rate movements because the prices of debt securities
tend to move in an opposite direction to interest rates. For instance,
debt securities prices generally fall when interest rates rise.</p>

<tr>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p><strong>Foreign currency or foreign exchange risk</strong>
</p>
</td>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>Funds that invest in assets denominated in foreign currencies may be exposed
to adverse currency movements. The fund’s currency base may also be different
from your own.</p>

<p><strong>Counterparty risk</strong>
</p>
</td>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>Funds may be exposed to the risk that the counterparty that they trade
with is unable to meet its payment obligations due to a deterioration of
the counterparty’s financial situation or otherwise.</p>

<h3>Are Funds Suitable For You?</h3>
<p>Investing in funds may not be for everyone. Before you invest, make sure
that you:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Want potentially higher returns BUT are also prepared for variable returns
which include the risk of losing a substantial part of your investment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Understand how returns are calculated or the factors that can affect returns,
such as fees and other expenses</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Understand the fund’s investment objective, strategy or approach. This
includes understanding how it intends to achieve its investment objective
under different market conditions, and how the limits it has in place on
the amount of risk it can take can affect its returns</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are clear about the fund’s benchmark and whether the fund is seeking to
outperform, or merely replicate the returns of the benchmark</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are familiar with the fund manager and fund’s track record</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Understand the risks associated with the fund</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Some funds use financial derivatives for hedging or investment purposes.
You should be aware of the risks associated with the use of financial derivatives,
including the risk that the provider (or counterparty) of the financial
derivatives defaults</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Understand how to interpret indicators, such as excess returns, active
share and tracking error, that are disclosed in fund disclosure documents.
You may refer to the section on ‘passive or active management’ for details
on active share and tracking error</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compare both active and passive funds to determine which type of funds
better meet your investment needs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are prepared to have your money tied up for long periods of time</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>As funds are exposed to market ups and downs, investors who stay invested
long enough may be better able to ride out the downturns</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You should have adequate financial resources so that you won’t have to
liquidate your funds during a market downturn. If you need to convert your
investments to cash in the short-term to meet specific needs, some funds
may not be suitable for you</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Types Of Funds</h3>
<p>There are different types of funds available, each with its own investment
objective and investment approach or strategy.</p>
<p>The investment objective may be capital appreciation or to generate income.
The fund manager decides the fund’s investment strategy (to achieve the
investment objective) and what assets to buy or sell.</p>
<p>Funds with the same investment objective may use different investment
strategies to achieve the same goal. You should ensure that the fund manager’s
investment style is in line with your own investment objectives.</p>
<p><strong>When choosing a fund, consider the following:</strong>
</p>
<p>What assets it invests in</p>
<p>Investment strategy or approach?</p>
<p>Risk and return profile</p>
<p>Passive or active management</p>

keep abreast of how your fund is doing.</p>
<h3>Checklist</h3>
<h4>Key Questions To Ask Before Investing</h4>
<p>Funds differ in terms of investment objectives, strategies, risks and
costs. Before you invest, consider the following:</p>
<p><strong>Do you know your own investment objectives?</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Make a list of your needs and goals, personal circumstances and risk profile.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What investment objectives are you trying to achieve by adding this fund
to your investment portfolio?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Does the fund match your objectives and risk profile?</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Ensure that the fund’s investment strategies are in line with your own
objectives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make sure you understand the risks and are comfortable that it matches
your own risk profile.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensure that the fund you are investing in fits in with your portfolio’s
over risk-return profile and does not concentrate your exposure to certain
risks</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Are you comfortable with the fund manager?</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>You should be satisfied that the fund manager has the necessary resources,
experience and skills to manage your investment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check their track record. However, note that past performance is not necessarily
an indication of future performance.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Do you need financial advice?</strong>
</p>
<p>If you need financial advice to help you decide whether to buy a fund
and which fund to buy, please speak to a financial adviser representative.</p>
<p>However, if you do not need financial advice, you may consider buying
the fund through other channels that may cost less, such as platforms offered
by banks or online fund platforms. What are the fees and charges you will
incur?</p>
<p><strong>Find out what you will be charged, when and why. You can ask some of the following questions:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>What are all the fees relating to this purchase? Is there a fee schedule
that lists all of the fees, both one-time and ongoing, that will be charged?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are any of the fees avoidable or negotiable?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can I lower my costs by buying a fund through a different financial institution
or online fund platforms?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How is my financial adviser being remunerated? What kind of service is
expected for the remuneration?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Have you compared it to other products?</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Find out about alternative investment products and compare their risk-return
profile and features with the product introduced to you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assess all the fees and charges that you will incur in buying and holding
a fund before deciding whether to invest in it. Compare the fees and charges
that will be incurred by (i) different funds with the same investment objectives
or approach, and (ii) the same fund through different channels.</p>
</li>
</ul>
