<h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Funds can be priced using either “bid and offer pricing” or “single pricing”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The unit price is based on the fund’s net asset value (NAV) divided by
the number of units outstanding</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will need to pay sales or redemption charges when you subscribe to
or redeem units</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Recurring fees are paid by the fund and include management fees, trustee
fees and other fees. These costs are passed on to you</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Funds are priced either by the “bid and offer pricing” method or the “single
pricing” method. You can find details of the pricing method in the prospectus
and the product highlights sheet.</p>
<p>You can get updated valuations of your fund from the daily newspapers
and the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.fundsingapore.com/screener/basic_search" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">FundSingapore.com</a>&nbsp;website.
Most funds in Singapore allow daily buying and selling of units.</p>
<h3>How The Price Is Determined</h3>
<p>The price of each unit is based on the fund’s&nbsp;<strong>Net Asset Value (NAV)</strong>&nbsp;divided
by the number of units outstanding.</p>
<p>The NAV is the market value of the fund's net assets (investments, cash
and other assets minus expenses, payables and other liabilities). The NAV
is usually computed daily to reflect changes in the prices of the investments
held by the fund</p>
<h3>Bid And Offer Pricing</h3>
<p>In the “bid and offer pricing” method, the subscription charge is added
to the NAV per unit, while the redemption charge is deducted from the NAV
per unit.</p>
<p>Here is what the terms mean:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Bid –</strong>&nbsp;Price at which investors sell their units</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Offer –</strong>&nbsp;Price at which investors buy units</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Spread –</strong>&nbsp;Difference (spread) between bid and offer
prices of fund’s units reflects subscription (sales) and redemption charges
(if any)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Single Pricing</h3>
<p>The fund provides a single quote that reflects the NAV per unit. The subscription
charges are deducted from the amount invested before the units are allocated.
Any redemption charge will be deducted from the redemption proceeds.</p>
<h3>Fees And Charges</h3>
<p>Fees can reduce the returns from your unit trusts. Fees are usually payable
regardless of how well or poorly the fund performs. For your fund to grow
in value, the returns must be greater than the fees and charges incurred.</p>
<p>It is also important to assess if the fees paid justify the ongoing advice/
service the distributor offers you, and the costs of the fund manager managing
the underlying investments in the fund.</p>
<p>There are two broad categories of fees:</p>
<h4>One-off Fees And Charges</h4>
<p>These fees are usually charged once per transaction when you subscribe
into or redeem a fund. Typically, these fees are paid to the distributor
and may be negotiable between you and the distributor.</p>

<h4>Recurrent Fees And Charges</h4>
<p>There are two types of recurring fees;</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Fees that are payable by you; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fees that the fund manager and other parties charge the fund for providing
their services.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Fees That Are Payable By You&nbsp;</h3>
<h4>Platform Fees</h4>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>This is incurred if you buy funds through a fund platform or buy funds
through a financial adviser who uses a fund platform</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ranges from 0 – 0.3% per annum of the total value of fund holdings held
with the fund platform</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Payable to the fund platform provider</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Platform fees will be deducted from the cash holdings placed with the
fund platform. If you do not have cash holdings placed with the fund platform,
some of your fund holdings (typically the best-performing ones) would be
sold off to pay the platform fees</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Wrap Fees&nbsp;</h4>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Payable to the distributor if you sign up for a wrap account</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Approximately 1% per annum of the total value of assets under the advice
of the distributor&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Payable to the distributor</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fees Charged To The Fund</h3>
<h4>Management Fees &nbsp;</h4>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Payable to the fund manager for managing the fund.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Actively managed funds charge management fees ranging from 1.0% - 2.0%
per annum of the fund’s NAV, while passively managed funds generally charge
management fees below 1%.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>20% - 60% of the management fees are paid by the fund manager to the distributor
so that the distributor would provide ongoing advice/service to you. This
amount paid to the distributor is also known as a trailer fee.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Other Fees</h4>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Payable to the fund’s service provider such as the trustee, administrator,
custodian, accounting and valuation provider and auditor</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The fees charged to the fund make up the&nbsp;<strong>Total Expense Ratio (TER)</strong>.
The TER is usually between 1.0% and 2.5% of the fund’s NAV and should be
disclosed in the fund’s factsheet.</p>
<p><strong>Tip: </strong>Assess a fund’s TER before deciding whether to invest
in it. Use the TER to compare the costs that will be incurred by (i)&nbsp;different
funds with the same investment objectives or approach, and (ii) the same
fund through different channels. Assess an actively managed fund's TER
and track record against its passively managed equivalent, if any, before
deciding whether to invest in it, and vice versa.</p>
<h3>The Bottom Line</h3>
<p>Find out the maximum amount that the fund can levy for each charge. Ask
for a clear breakdown of all the fees and charges that you expect to pay
for your investment. Do note that charges that are not currently levied
may still be imposed in the future.</p>
