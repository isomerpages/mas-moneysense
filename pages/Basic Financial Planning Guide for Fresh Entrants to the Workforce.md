<h4>Emergency funds</h4>
<p>To work out how much you need in emergency funds, compile your household
and personal expenses in a month, including loan repayments, credit card
bills, insurance premiums, and taxes. When budgeting for your expenses,
a useful tip is to separate the essentials from the good-to-haves. Aim
to set aside enough to cover at least 3 to 6 months’ worth of expenses.
If your income is irregular, aim to have savings equivalent to 12 months
of expenses.</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Prioritise paying off high interest debts (e.g., credit card bills), to
avoid high interest charges</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>MediShield Life</h4>
<p>MediShield Life is a national health insurance that covers large hospital
bills and selected costly outpatient treatments such as cancer treatments
and dialysis. All Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents are covered
by MediShield Life and premiums can be fully paid using your MediSave.
If you prefer to choose your own doctor, or opt for private hospitals or
Class B1/A wards in public hospitals, your hospital bill would be larger.
Private insurers offer Integrated Shield Plans (IPs)*, which provide additional
coverage on top of MediShield Life to help with your out-of-pocket expenses.
When making a decision to buy an IP, evaluate your needs and be mindful
of the long-term costs that increase significantly with age. You can use
MediSave to cover IP premiums, but it has withdrawal limits. If your IP
premium(excluding MediShield Life) exceeds these limits, you may need to
pay a portion using cash.</p>
<blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>Half of Singapore residents with IPs do not utilise their IP benefits
fully<strong> </strong>by choosing to stay in Class B2/C wards when hospitalised.
In such cases, MediShield Life’s coverage would be sufficient and additional
IP may not be necessary.</p>

<p><em>*IP policyholders are also not eligible for Additional Premium Support (APS), which is a form of financial assistance for MediShield Life/CareShield Life premiums. If you are currently receiving APS to pay for your MediShield Life and/or CareShield Life premiums, you will stop receiving APS if you choose to be insured under an IP. This applies even if you are not the person paying for the IP.</em>

<h4>Coverage for death, total permanent disability and critical illness</h4>
<p>The Life Insurance Association of Singapore recommends coverage of:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>9x annual income for death and total permanent disability; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>4x annual income for standard critical illness</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Dependants’ Protection Scheme (DPS) is a term life insurance scheme that
provides a one-off payout (up to $70,000 until age 60; up to $55,000 from
above age 60 to 65) in the event of death, terminal illness or total permanent
disability. It is automatically extended to you upon your first CPF working
contribution.</p>
<p>Term insurance policies are a cost-effective way to ensure protection,
especially when lower premiums are “locked-in” at a younger age.</p>
<p>Premiums for term insurance policies are usually cheaper compared to whole
life insurance policies, for the same level of protection. This is because
most term insurance policies only provide insurance protection and do not
have any investment element (i.e. no surrender value).</p>
<p>For more affordable options, explore:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Group term insurance policies (e.g. MINDEF &amp; MHA group term insurance
policies applicable to Full-time National Servicemen and their dependants);
and</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Direct Purchase Insurance. No commission is charged as this option does
not come with any financial advice.</p>

<h4>CPF and your retirement</h4>
<p>Your CPF savings help to prepare for your retirement from the moment you
begin working. Grow your retirement savings by making cash top-ups and/or
CPF transfer to your CPF Special/Retirement Account. You can enjoy up to
$8,000 in tax relief on your cash top-ups and receive higher monthly payouts
due to compounding interest when you retire!You should start investing
to grow your wealth too. Take advantage of your long time horizon and the
power of compounding interest</p>

<h4>Home purchase</h4>
<p>For many Singaporeans, a home will be the largest purchase and investment
that one will make. It is important that you plan your finances and budget
for a flat purchase carefully with HDB’s ABCs of financial planning and
financial tools.</p>

<h4>Investments</h4>
<p>An important aspect of investing is understanding your own circumstances
and the product before you put your money in it. Considerations include
your financial goals, needs, investment horizon, risk appetite and budget,
as well as the product’s features, terms, benefits and risks. ​</p>
<p>Every investment bears risk. In some cases, you could lose some or all
of the money you invested. Bear in mind that there is no free lunch - the
higher the potential returns, the higher the risks! ​</p>
<p>For lower risk products, you may consider Singapore Savings Bonds, T-bills
and fixed deposits that are capital guaranteed by the Government or banks.</p>
<p>​Diversification is a way to manage investment risks, by allocating funds
across different asset classes (e.g. stocks and bonds), different industries
and different countries.</p>
<p>There are diversified investment products such as Exchange Traded Funds
(ETFs) and/or Unit Trusts (UTs),which can help you spread your investment
across different asset classes, industries and countries. ​There are also
bundled products which have both investment and protection elements. Examples
of such bundled products include whole life policies, investment linked
policies (ILPs) and endowment plans.</p>
<p>​Pay attention to the fees and charges incurred when purchasing investment
products as these will reduce your returns. You are also strongly encouraged
to purchase investment products through MAS regulated financial institutions.</p>
