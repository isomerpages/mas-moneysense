<h4>Emergency funds</h4>
<p>To work out how much you need in emergency funds, compile your household
and personal expenses in a month, including loan repayments, credit card
bills, insurance premiums, and taxes. When budgeting for your expenses,
a useful tip is to separate the essentials from the good-to-haves. Aim
to set aside enough to cover at least 3 to 6 months’ worth of expenses.
If your income is irregular, aim to have savings equivalent to 12 months
of expenses.</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Prioritise paying off high interest debts (e.g., credit card bills), to
avoid high interest charges</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>MediShield Life</h4>
<p>MediShield Life is a national health insurance that covers large hospital
bills and selected costly outpatient treatments such as cancer treatments
and dialysis. All Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents are covered
by MediShield Life and premiums can be fully paid using your MediSave.
If you prefer to choose your own doctor, or opt for private hospitals or
Class B1/A wards in public hospitals, your hospital bill would be larger.
Private insurers offer Integrated Shield Plans (IPs)*, which provide additional
coverage on top of MediShield Life to help with your out-of-pocket expenses.
When making a decision to buy an IP, evaluate your needs and be mindful
of the long-term costs that increase significantly with age. You can use
MediSave to cover IP premiums, but it has withdrawal limits. If your IP
premium(excluding MediShield Life) exceeds these limits, you may need to
pay a portion using cash.</p>
