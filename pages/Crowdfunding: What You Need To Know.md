<p>Crowd funding arrangements which do not involve the offer of securities
(for example, where contributions are in the form of donations or pre-payment
for merchandise under donation-based and reward-based crowd funding respectively)
are not subject to MAS' regulations.</p>
<p>Lending-based and equity-based crowd funding which involve offers of securities
by companies are generally referred to as securities-based crowd funding
(SCF). SCF is subject to securities regulations, but not lending-based
crowd funding occurring directly between individuals.</p>
<h3>Is Crowdfunding Regulated?</h3>
<p>SCF is an alternative source of financing for start-ups and SMEs.</p>
<p>All SCF platform operators who want to operate in Singapore must be licensed
by MAS. Only donation-based and rewards-based crowdfunding that do not
involve offers of securities, are not subject to MAS’ regulations.</p>
<h3>What Are The Risks?</h3>
<p>Before signing up or agreeing to contribute funds to a crowdfunding platform,
you should always read the terms and conditions and understand the risks
involved.</p>
<p>Common risks associated with crowdfunding include:</p>

all your money. You should find out the recourse if the SCF platform ceases
business or fails. Check if there is an appointed party who can assist
with debt recovery.</p>

<p>You may not receive enough information to make a fully informed investment
decision as there is no regulatory requirement for issuers and SCF platform
operators to provide specific information on the securities offered.</p>
<p>Also, the financial statements of the issuers may not have been audited.
An unaudited financial statement may not reflect the true financial health
of a company. For foreign issuers, the financial statements of the issuers
may not be made accessible to you if there are no requirements in their
home country to do so.</p>
<h3>Requirements For Operators</h3>
<p>MAS will only admit SCF platform operators that are assessed to be fit
and proper.</p>
<p>Operators must:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Ensure proper segregation of investors’ monies</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keep proper records of transactions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deal fairly with investors in the conduct of their business</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Disclose the key risks of the investments to you</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>They must issue a prospectus unless the offer falls within these exemptions:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Small offers: Personal offers of securities less than $5 million within
any 12-month period.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Private placement: An offer of securities to no more than 50 persons within
a 12-month period.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>But they must disclose the key risks (as prescribed by MAS at a minimum)
of such investments to you. Before investing, you will be required to acknowledge
that you have read and understood these risks. Do take time to consider
the investment carefully as ultimately investors bear responsibility for
their investment decisions.</p>
<p>If a licensed operator is found to have breached MAS’ rules, supervisory
steps will be taken, ranging from enhanced audits to revoking the licence.</p>
<h3>Overseas Crowdfunding Platforms</h3>
<p>Any platform that solicits funds from investors in Singapore will be subject
to a prospectus and other requirements.</p>
<p>However, there are limits to the enforcement of local requirements on
crowd funding platforms which do not have any presence in Singapore. Be
extra vigilant if you decide to take part in such offers.</p>
<p>MAS aims to safeguard your interests by ensuring only competent and professional
persons provide financial services to investors in Singapore. If you deal
with an unregulated person or entity, you will forgo MAS’ protection.</p>
<h3>If Something Goes Wrong</h3>
<p>Take these steps to resolve any disputes:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Approach the SCF platform if there's a default on payment.<br></strong>Explore
the debt recovery options and costs to be borne by you (if any). Some SCF
platforms engage agencies on investors' behalf to collect outstanding debts
from the issuers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Speak to your Financial Institution (FI).<br></strong>You should
seek help with your FI as they have easy access to your records. All FIs
are expected to handle consumer complaints and feedback independently and
promptly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Approach FIDReC.<br></strong>If you are unable to resolve your
problem, you may approach the <a href="https://www.fidrec.com.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Financial Industry Disputes Resolution Centre Ltd (FIDReC)</a> within
6 months of receiving the final reply from the FI.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Checklist</h3>
<p>Before committing any money, take a moment to consider the following:</p>
<h4>Have You Conducted Due Diligence?</h4>
<p>Read the terms and conditions on the SCF platform carefully before signing
up or agreeing to contribute funds. Assess whether you are satisfied with
the extent of the due diligence that the SCF platform operator conducts
on issuers before allowing deals to be listed on the platform.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Find out if checks have been conducted on the issuer's board of directors
or senior management, financial performance and ability to repay the funds.
Such checks should minimally include past credit records, cash flow and
financial strength of the issuer</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Also check with the SCF platform operator on the total outstanding loans
of an issuer</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>What Are The Non-Performing Loan Rates?</h4>
<p>Don't focus just on the SCF operator's interest rates of return. You should
also examine the non-performing loan rates to get an indication of the
loans which have defaulted on interest or principal repayments to investors.</p>
<h4>What Happens If The Platform Closes Down?</h4>
<p>Find out what courses of action are available if the SCF platform ceases
business. SCF platform operators are expected to put in place proper business
cessation plans and disclose the arrangements and communications which
they will make if that happens.</p>
<p>Questions to ask include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>How will investors receive their future repayments from the issuers?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Will there be another party appointed to help investors monitor future
repayments due from issuers or assist with debt recovery?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are the arrangements for handling investors' monies (i.e. whether
investors monies are placed in segregated trust accounts) or loan agreements
kept on behalf of investors?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are the procedures for communication with investors regarding business
cessation?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Do You Understand The Investment?</h4>
<p>Make sure you fully understand the benefits and risks of the product or
service before committing. Assess whether the features of the product or
service offered meet your needs.</p>
