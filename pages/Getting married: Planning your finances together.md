**Don't let money put a strain on your relationship. Find out how you can work together to achieve your financial goals as a couple.**

#### Working on your new financial life together
-------------------------------------------
One of the most important parts of a marriage is knowing how to manage your money together.

Differing attitudes towards money can pose challenges to a relationship. For example, what seems sensible and prudent to you may seem stingy to him or her. If you are used to lavishing each other with extravagant gifts, you might no longer find this desirable or sensible once you get married and have bills to pay.

Planning ahead together can help you build a strong foundation for your marriage.

#### What you should do
------------------

Here are some tips for you:

#### 1\. Learn each other's spending habits

Find out each other's style of managing money, and adapt to each other. If your partner is a spender, agree on some limits. Make your expectations clear and find some common ground.

#### 2\. Draw up a budget together

Make extra effort to draw up a joint budget. This will help you track how your salaries are being spent, and find ways to improve your finances.

#### 3\. Share expenses and save for common goals

Find a way to share your household expenses and save for your emergency funds and retirement.

Agree on each personâ€™s contribution, it may be in proportion to the income. For example, one person could be servicing the home loan while the other could be paying the bills.

#### 4\. Set goals and work towards them

After setting your financial goals, take responsibility to live within your means. You might be a young couple now starting out with promising careers, but one day you may stop working when kids come along, or to take care of elderly parents. Expenses will also go up as your family grows. So do plan and save up early.

#### 5\. Avoid impulse spending or borrowing

Do not make large financial commitments on your own or on impulse. Instead, discuss them with your spouse first.

#### 6\. Sort out the important things first

As you move on to the next stage of life, it's also time to review your health and life insurance.
