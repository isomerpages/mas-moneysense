<h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>You are exposed to the risk of the asset that the contract for difference
(CFD) is based on e.g., shares, currencies or commodities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a CFD buyer, you do not own the underlying asset</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A CFD is a Specified Investment Product. You need to complete a Customer
Knowledge Assessment (CKA) before you can open a CFD account and begin
trading</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A contract for difference (CFD) allows you to speculate on the future
market movements of the underlying asset, without actually owning or taking
physical delivery of the underlying asset.</p>
<p>CFDs are leveraged instruments. They tend to be traded over-the-counter
with a securities firm, known as a CFD provider. A CFD is a Specified Investment
Product (SIP).</p>
<p>CFDs are available for a range of underlying assets, e.g., shares, commodities
and foreign exchange. In this guide, examples showing how they work will
refer to shares as the underlying asset class.</p>
<h3>How It Works</h3>
<p>A CFD involves two trades:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>First, you enter into an opening trade with a CFD provider at one price.
This creates an open position which you later close out with a reverse
trade with the CFD provider at another price.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the first trade is a buy or long position, the second trade which closes
the open position is a sell. Conversely, if the opening trade was a sell
or short position, the closing trade would be a buy.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The CFD captures the price difference of the underlying asset between
the opening trade and the closing-out trade.</p>

<p>The proceeds you pay or receive will be subject to commissions, financing
charges, other charges or other adjustments made by the CFD provider.</p>
<h3>Returns And Losses</h3>
<p>The CFD captures the price difference of the underlying asset between
the opening trade and the closing-out trade.</p>
<p>Trading in leveraged products like CFDs potentially exposes you to a higher
risk of loss than if the products were not leveraged. With leveraged products,
you may lose more than what you originally invested depending on the positions
you take.</p>
<p>As an investor, you pay an initial margin to open the position and are
required to maintain some minimum margin level for open positions at all
times.</p>
<p>Note that:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>You may be required to satisfy the margin calls at very short notice,
especially in volatile markets</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you fail to top up your margin when required, you risk having your
position liquidated at a loss</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Why Trade CFDs?</h3>
<p>A CFD allows you to speculate on the future market movements of an underlying
asset, without actually owning or taking physical delivery of the underlying
asset.</p>
<h3>What Are The Risks?</h3>
<p>Common risks associated with CFDs include the following:</p>

<li>
<p>You are taking a position on the future direction of the price of an underlying
asset but your view turns out to be wrong</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In some cases, the loss is potentially unlimited and can be much more
than the cost of the initial margin</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some CFD providers may offer stop loss or limit order measures which allow
you to limit losses by setting price triggers to close the open position.
Check with your CFD provider if this is available to you. However, these
measures may not be guaranteed, which means that the closing out price
may be more unfavourable than indicated in the stop loss order</p>

<h3>Things To Note</h3>
<p>CFDs have certain features that you should take note of:</p>
<h4>Trading Prerequisites</h4>
<p>In Singapore, CFDs are unlisted <a href="https://www.moneysense.gov.sg/understanding-specified-investment-products" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Specified Investment Products (SIP)</a>,
so you need to complete a Customer Knowledge Assessment (CKA) before you
can open a CFD account and begin trading.</p>
<h4>You Trade On Margin</h4>
<p>CFDs are traded on margin. This means you pay a small proportion of the
value of the underlying shares (typically between 10% and 20%, as set by
the CFD provider) to open the position, instead of paying the full value
for the underlying shares.</p>
<div data-type="detailGroup" class="isomer-accordion-group isomer-accordion isomer-accordion-white">
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary>Example 1: Initial Margin</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Suppose the shares of XYZ Ltd, are quoted at an offer price of $2 and
Millie intends to buy 2,000 shares of XYZ Ltd as a CFD at the offer price
of $2.</p>
<p>Assuming the CFD provider sets the margin of the CFD at 10%, the initial
margin Millie puts up will be 10% x $2 x 2,000 = $400.</p>
<p>Millie will be able to open the position with $400 versus a payment of
$4,000 for the underlying shares.</p>
</div>
</details>
</div>
<h4>Leverage Magnifies Profits And Losses</h4>
<p>The leveraging effect means that if the markets move in favour of or against
Millie’s position, her respective profits or losses will be magnified.
Here are some examples of how leverage impacts Millie’s profits and losses.</p>
<div data-type="detailGroup" class="isomer-accordion isomer-accordion-white">
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary>Example 2: Turning A Profit</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Suppose on the next day, the shares of XYZ Ltd have risen and are quoted
at a bid price of $2.05. Millie then decides to sell her CFD at $2.05:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>She will gain a profit of $100 [($2.05- $2.00) x 2000].</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The return on investment (ROI) from the CFD works out to <strong>25%</strong> (100
÷ 400). This compares to an ROI of about <strong>2.5%</strong> (100 ÷ 4,000)
if she had invested directly in the underlying shares.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Millie will receive from the CFD provider $100, less any financing, transaction
costs and commissions due from her.</p>
</div>
</details>
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary>Example 3: Suffering A Loss</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Example 3: Suffering a loss</p>
<p>Conversely, if the market moves against Millie’s position and the shares
of XYZ Ltd are quoted at $1.95, Millie may choose to sell her shares at
$1.95 to avoid incurring further loss:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>She will incur a loss of $100 [($ 1.95 - $2.00) x 2000] from trading the
CFD.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ROI for investing in the CFD would be <strong>-25%</strong> (-100 ÷
400), as compared to an ROI of <strong>-2.5%</strong> (-100 ÷ 4,000) if she
had invested directly in the underlying shares.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>However, Millie will end up paying more than $100 to the CFD provider,
once financing, transaction costs and commissions are factored in.</p>
<p>In the worst case scenario, the shares of XYZ Ltd become worthless.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Millie will lose the full contract value of S$4,000 [(S$0 - S$2.00) X
2,000], similar to purchasing 2,000 shares at S$2 per share and losing
the entire initial investment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Millie will also be liable for additional charges, costs and fees incurred.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</details>
</div>
<h4>Margins Can Be Called At Short Notice</h4>
<p>At any time that the markets move against your open position, the CFD
provider will require you to top up your margin with additional funds to
cover your losses. This is known as a <strong>margin call.</strong>
</p>
<p>In the above Example 3, if Millie intends to keep the position open, the
$100 loss will be deducted from the initial margin and she will be required
to top up her margin to the initial amount of $400, or to a level prescribed
by the CFD provider.</p>
<p>The prescribed margin should be made known to you before entering into
the CFD. You will usually be required to make the top up within a short
period of time (e.g. within 1 day or as required by the CFD provider).</p>
<h4>If You Can't Meet A Margin Call</h4>
<p>If you can't meet a margin call within the required timeframe, the CFD
provider can close your position without notifying you. The price at which
your CFD is closed out will depend on the available price of the underlying
share or asset at that point in time.</p>
<p>This process of valuing the profit and loss of open positions is called
"marking to market". This, coupled with managing margin requirements, is
a continuous process.</p>
<p>If you want to trade CFDs, you must:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Be financially prepared to top up margins at short notice, especially
when markets are volatile.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Monitor your account closely to ensure that you deal with any margin calls
promptly.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Risks Of Short Selling</h4>
<p>Various restrictions apply to short selling in the stock markets. CFDs,
however, allow you to take short positions, without having to first own
the underlying shares.</p>
<p>But taking short positions can be very risky and can potentially lead
to unlimited losses.</p>
<div data-type="detailGroup" class="isomer-accordion-group isomer-accordion isomer-accordion-white">
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary>Example 4: Short Selling A CFD</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Suppose Millie expects the shares of XYZ Ltd, quoted at $2, to fall. She
can sell 2,000 shares at $2, as a CFD. The initial outlay to open the position
will be $400 (10% x $2 x 2,000).</p>
<p>After 7 days, the shares of XYZ Ltd are quoted at $1.95:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Millie decides to close the position by buying 2,000 shares at $1.95 as
a CFD</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The profit made will be $100 [2,000 x ($2 - $1.95)] or 25% ROI, although
the actual amount received will be less once transaction and other costs
are deducted</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Costs Of Trading CFDs</h3>
<p>Costs relating to CFD trades may include bid-offer spreads, commissions,
daily financing costs, account management fees and Goods and Services Tax
(GST).</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The commission charge is usually a percentage of the total value of the
underlying shares and paid on a per transaction basis. There could be a
minimum commission per transaction. The cost of the trading services may
also be quoted in the form of a bid-offer spread on the CFD. Do clarify
this with the CFD provider before trading in CFDs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The commission is subjected GST</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Financing charges may be calculated on the total value of the underlying
shares of the CFD. Some providers may, however, charge based on mark to
market value instead of the opening or initial contract value</p>
</li>
</ul>
<div data-type="detailGroup" class="isomer-accordion isomer-accordion-white">
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary>Example 5: Commission And GST Charges</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Suppose XYZ Ltd is quoted at $2 and Millie intends to buy 2,000 shares
of XYZ Ltd as a CFD at $2. The commission, assuming as rate of 0.5% and
no minimum commission, is $2 x 2,000 x 0.5% = $20.</p>
<p>GST (at 9% of $20) of $1.80 will be levied.</p>
</div>
</details>
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary>Example 6: Financing Charges</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>If Millie holds 2,000 shares as a CFD overnight, she will incur daily
financing interest, which may be set at, say, 5% of the initiated contract
value. If the opening CFD price of the shares is $2, the daily interest
charge will be ($4,000 x 5% / 360 days) = $0.56.</p>
</div>
</details>
</div>
<h3>When A CFD Expires</h3>
<p>CFDs may or may not have expiry dates. It is decided by the CFD provider.
Do clarify this with your CFD provider.</p>
<p>For those with expiry dates, you will have to <strong>close out your position</strong> at
expiry.</p>
<p>If you wish to maintain your exposure to the underlying shares beyond
the expiry of the CFD, you will have to initiate a new position by entering
into a new CFD. The position is said to be "rolled over" and the profits
or losses are realised when the original position is closed.</p>
<p>The new CFD position may be subject to commissions and financing charges.
Meanwhile, your account may require adjustments to margin, as well as to
reflect current profit and loss status.</p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>Do be vigilant about monitoring open positions
where there is no expiry date.</p>
<h3>Your Rights In Ccorporate Actions</h3>
<p>As a CFD buyer, you will not have bought the underlying shares. Do check
with your CFD provider as well as check what rights you have as a CFD buyer.</p>
<p>Buyers of CFDs may be entitled to adjustments to their CFDs, if dividends
on the underlying shares are paid by the respective companies.</p>
<h3>Key questions to ask before trading CFDs</h3>
<p>CFDs carry a higher level of risk because of their speculative and leveraged
nature. Before you decide to trade CFDs, ask yourself the following:</p>
<p><strong>Do you fully understand how CFDs work?</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>How is the derivative contract quoted? Can the trade be executed at a
price that is different from my order price?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does the CFD have an expiry date? If so, when? What if you wish to continue
with the CFD after the expiry date?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are the costs you have to pay? What margin, commission, transaction
and financing charges are there? When are margin calls made?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where are the margins and deposits that you have placed with the CFD provider
kept and maintained? Will you be able to get back your margins and deposits
if the CFD provider becomes insolvent? How long will the recovery of your
monies take?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Do you fully understand the risks of investing in CFDs?</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>What is the maximum you can lose and how will this affect your financial
plans? Losses can be much higher than the initial margin invested. If you
are short selling, it may lead to unlimited losses.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Do you know what to watch out for when trading CFDs?</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Do you have the time to monitor the underlying shares or index?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How do you limit losses?</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Can you place stop loss and limit orders? How much do they cost?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you place a stop-loss order, are you assured of the price that you
set the stop-loss at?</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>What happens when a margin call is made?</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>What if you fail to meet a margin call? Can the company close your position?</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a buyer in a CFD, do you have rights in the underlying shares or index?</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>What if trading in the underlying asset is suspended or halted? Can you
sell the CFD? How can you exit your position, and will you suffer losses?</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is the CFD provider authorised or licensed to deal in CFDs? Do check the
MAS' <a href="https://eservices.mas.gov.sg/fid" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Financial Institutions Directory</a> for
whether the firm has the requisite authorisation or licence.</p>
</li>
</ul>
