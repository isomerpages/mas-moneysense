<h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The Deposit Insurance Scheme protects your deposits with a member bank
for up to $75,000 per depositor per bank</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All full banks and finance companies in Singapore are members of the scheme</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>What happens if a bank fails</h3>
<p>International experience has shown that banks can fail. Depositors can
lose their savings even in reputable and well-supervised jurisdictions.</p>
<p>While our banking system remains sound, things can go wrong in today's
complex and globalised environment.</p>
<p>In a bank failure, ordinary depositors may suffer the loss of their core
savings. These are the funds they need to get on with their lives â€” money
for groceries, school fees, utilities, phone bills, etc. before the next
pay cheque comes in.</p>
<h3>Deposit insurance</h3>
<p>The Deposit Insurance Scheme provides a basic level of protection to small
depositors. The <a href="https://www.sdic.org.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Singapore Deposit Insurance Corporation (SDIC)</a> administers
the scheme in Singapore.</p>
<p>Currently, the Deposit Insurance Scheme protects non-bank depositors (individuals,
charities, sole proprietorships, partnerships, companies, and unincorporated
entities) by covering their SGD monies placed with a Scheme member, for
up to <strong>$100,000</strong> per depositor per Scheme member.</p>
<p>All <a href="https://eservices.mas.gov.sg/fid/institution?sector=Banking&amp;category=Full%20Bank" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">full banks</a> and
<a href="https://eservices.mas.gov.sg/fid/institution?sector=Banking&amp;category=Finance%20Company" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">finance companies</a>in Singapore are required to be members of the Deposit
Insurance Scheme.</p>
<h3>What is covered</h3>
<p>The Deposit Insurance Scheme covers deposits in SGD held in standard savings,
current or fixed deposit accounts.</p>
<p>It also covers SGD monies placed with any scheme member under the Supplementary
Retirement Scheme, CPF Retirement Sum Scheme and CPF Investment Scheme.</p>
<p>It is also worth noting that deposits are not insured separately in each
branch office of a bank or finance company.</p>
<p>This means that all your eligible accounts maintained with different branches
of a full bank or finance company are aggregated and insured <strong>up to $100,000</strong> with
the same bank or finance company.</p>
<p>Monies placed under the CPF Retirement Sum Scheme and the CPF Investment
Scheme with a Deposit Insurance Scheme member are aggregated and separately
insured up to $100,000.</p>
<p>The $100,000 is a figure based on studies that show that the amount will
fully insure a vast majority of non-bank depositors from losses on their
insured accounts should their full bank or finance company fail.</p>
<h3>What is not insured</h3>
<p>Some deposits or bank products are <strong>not covered</strong> by deposit
insurance. They include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Foreign currency deposits</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Structured deposits</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Structured notes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Investment products like shares, unit trusts</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These products carry higher risks and do not form part of the core savings
or transaction accounts of small depositors. Those who buy them should
be prepared to assume the higher risks for the potentially higher rewards.</p>
<h3>Is your deposit insured?</h3>
<p>With banks and finance companies constantly creating new products, it
can be hard to know which deposits are covered by deposit insurance and
which are not.</p>
<p>An easy way to get such information is to go to their website or any of
their branches and ask for their register of insured products.</p>
<p>Scheme members are required to disclose in their deposit account statements,
account opening forms, and marketing materials if they are offering insured
products.</p>
