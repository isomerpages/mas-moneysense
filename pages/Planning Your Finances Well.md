<p>With so many tips on financial planning out there, it can be hard to ascertain
if you are on the right track, especially if you do not have a financial
adviser.</p>
<p>To help Singaporeans identify and plug gaps in their finances, the Monetary
Authority of Singapore and MoneySense, together with the CPF Board, Association
of Banks in Singapore, Association of Financial Advisers (Singapore) and
Life Insurance Association, have developed a Basic Financial Planning Guide.
It contains rules of thumb to support individuals taking proactive steps
to address their savings, insurance, and investment needs at different
life stages.</p>
<p>Check out the Guides below that could be more tailored to your needs (also
available in Chinese, Malay, and Tamil)!</p>
