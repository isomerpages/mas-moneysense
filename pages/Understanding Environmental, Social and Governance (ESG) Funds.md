<h3>What Is An ESG Fund?</h3>
<p>An ESG fund is a fund that uses environmental, social and/or governance
factors as its key investment focus and strategy. This means that ESG factors
significantly influence the fund’s selection of companies to invest in.</p>
<p>The ESG factors used by an ESG fund and the way they are used differ across
funds. Some examples of ESG factors include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Environmental </strong>– air and water pollution, greenhouse gas
emissions, biodiversity, energy consumption;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Social </strong>– labour standards, human rights, sustainable
product sourcing; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Governance </strong>– shareholder rights, corporate culture and
conduct, business ethics</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>What Is ESG Investing?</h3>
<p>In ESG investing, funds incorporate ESG factors in their investment strategies
or approaches in varying degrees as broadly set out below:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Integration</strong> is where a fund considers ESG factors, alongside
non-ESG factors such as company financial performance, in its decision
to invest in each asset. This may include taking into account ESG risks
in relation to climate change or corporate governance, which may become
more material to financial performance over time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Screening </strong>is where a fund seeks to either include assets
that meet certain ESG criteria (known as inclusionary investing or positive
screening) or exclude assets that do not meet certain ESG criteria (known
as exclusionary investing or negative screening)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Impact investing </strong>is where<strong> </strong>a fund seeks
to achieve measurable ESG goals or outcomes (e.g. low carbon or renewable
energy technology or solutions, sustainable infrastructure development
or affordable housing)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Funds may also play an active role in shaping the ESG practices of companies
that they invest in. For example, as a shareholder, a fund can influence
a company’s actions by engaging with the board and senior management, as
well as voting at general meetings.</p>
<h3>What Is Greenwashing?</h3>
<p>As an investor looking to invest in ESG funds, you should watch out for
greenwashing, which is the risk that a fund may present itself as more
ethical, sustainable or environmentally sound than it actually is, or has
a greater positive impact on ESG outcomes than it actually does.</p>
<p>A fund may also present the sustainability targets of its underlying investments
as more ambitious or aligned with legally binding international climate
treaties or national commitments than they actually are.</p>
<p>An example of greenwashing is when a fund claims to achieve a certain
level of ESG impact through its investment strategy without sufficient
or credible evidence to support that claim.</p>
<h3>Things To Consider When Investing In An ESG Fund</h3>
<p>As with any other financial products, you should think about the following
before investing in an ESG fund:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Your ESG investing goals – </strong>What are your ESG investing
goals? To reduce carbon emissions or invest in companies with sustainable
and/or ethical practices? How ‘green’ do you want the fund to be?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The ESG fund’s investment strategy</strong> – Will the fund’s strategy
meet your ESG investing goals? Will a fund that invests in companies providing
solutions to specific environmental or social challenges meet your ESG
investing goals?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>What You Should Look Out For As An Investor</h3>
<p>To ensure that adequate disclosures are made on the ESG aspects of a fund
and mitigate risks of greenwashing, a fund that markets or represents itself
as an ESG fund to retail investors must comply with MAS’ Disclosure and
Reporting Guidelines for Retail ESG Funds (MAS Circular).</p>
<p>Under the MAS Circular, an ESG fund is one where ESG factors significantly
influence the selection of investment assets. A fund that only uses negative
screening or a fund that merely integrates ESG considerations into its
investment process to seek financial returns would not qualify as an ESG
fund under the MAS Circular.</p>
<p>In addition, ESG funds must disclose the following information in its
prospectus and annual reports:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>the fact that the fund is an ESG fund under MAS Circular;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the fund’s ESG investment focus and strategy;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>risks associated with the fund’s ESG investment focus and strategy;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>how the fund’s ESG investment focus is met and monitored;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>proportion of investment that meet the fund’s ESG investment focus;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>any action taken by the fund manager in achieving the fund’s ESG investment
focus;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>sources of ESG data used</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Two Key Steps To Take When Considering ESG Funds</h4>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Check whether a fund is an ESG fund under the MAS Circular </strong>–
look out for whether a fund’s offering documents (prospectus and product
highlights sheet) disclose this fact. If they do, they should disclose
all the information listed above, to help you understand its ESG strategy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Carefully read the offering documents, annual reports and website of an ESG fund.</strong> Do
not invest in an ESG fund – or any fund for that matter – until you study
all the relevant information carefully, to find out if it is suitable for
you.</p>
</li>
</ol>
