<h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>REITs invest in real estate properties and distribute revenues generated
from these assets (primarily rental income) at regular intervals to REIT
holders</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>REITs are professionally managed by REIT managers and property managers
who charge a fee in exchange for their services</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are a variety of REITs listed on the Singapore Exchange and you
can buy them in the same way as you would buy a stock</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>What Are REITs?</h3>
<p>When you invest in a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT), your money is
pooled together with other investors' in a collective investment scheme
that invests in a portfolio of income generating real estate assets such
as shopping malls, offices, hotels or serviced apartments.</p>
<p>These assets are professionally managed and revenues generated from assets
(primarily rental income) are normally distributed at regular intervals
to REIT holders, after accounting for fees such as REIT management fees
and property management fees.</p>
<p>The REIT’s investment goal is to generate income distribution and long-term
appreciation potential.</p>
<p>You can invest in them the same way as you would invest in stocks, through
your broker.</p>
<h3>How It Works</h3>
<p>A typical REIT structure works like this:</p>
<p>Money is raised from unit holders through an Initial Public Offering (IPO)
and used by the REIT to purchase a pool of real estate properties.</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>These properties are then leased out to tenants</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In return, the income flows back to the unit holders (investors) as income
distributions (which are similar to dividends)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Most REITs have annual REIT managers’ fees, property manager’s fees, trustees’
fees and other expenses that will be deducted from their profits before
distributions are made.</p>
<p>Some REITs which hold properties in foreign jurisdictions may also be
subject to taxation by the relevant jurisdictions. Investors can find information
on these fees in the REITs’ prospectuses and financial statements.</p>
<p>The figure below shows a typical REIT structure.</p>

<h3>Roles in a REIT</h3>
<p>A REIT structure typically has the following key roles:</p>
<p><strong>Trustee</strong>
</p>
<p>The trustee’s duties are set out in the trust deed. The trustee is responsible
for holding the assets of the REIT on behalf of unit holders. Other duties
may include ensuring compliance with all applicable laws and protecting
certain rights of unit holders.</p>
<p>The trustee is paid a fee for providing this service.</p>
<p><strong>REIT Manager Or Property Manager</strong>
</p>
<p>The REIT manager sets and executes the strategic direction of the REIT
according to its stated investment strategy. For instance, it is responsible
for the acquisition and divestment of the REIT’s properties.</p>
<p>In an externally-managed model, the REIT manager charges a management
fee that includes a base fee and performance fee in exchange for its services.
It may also charge additional fees such as acquisition and divestment fees.</p>
<p>A REIT manager typically appoints a property manager to manage the real
estate properties of the REIT. The property manager’s responsibility includes
renting out the property to achieve the best tenancy mix and rental income,
to run marketing events or programmes to attract shoppers/ tenants and
to upkeep the property.</p>
<p>In return, the property manager is paid a property management fee out
of the assets of the REIT.</p>
<p><strong>REIT Sponsor</strong>
</p>
<p>In some cases, there is a sponsor who sources the properties that are
injected into the initial portfolio of the REIT and may continue to provide
a pipeline of assets for the REIT.</p>
<p>Usually the sponsor also owns stakes in the REIT manager and the REIT.</p>
<h3>Your Rights As A REIT Unit Holder</h3>
<p>In general, these are limited to the right to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Require the REIT manager or trustee to administer the REIT in accordance
with the provisions of the trust deed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remove a REIT manager</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To remove a REIT manager, unit holders have to call for a general meeting
to vote on a resolution to remove the REIT manager. The call for general
meeting must be made in writing to the REIT manager or trustee by at least
50 unit holders or such number of unit holders that together hold at least
10% of the REIT’s issued units.</p>
<p>The resolution to remove the REIT manager must then be passed by a simple
majority of unit holders present and voting at the general meeting, with
no unit holders being disenfranchised.</p>
<h3>Before You Invest: Things To Note</h3>
<p>Do not assume that REITs are low risk and that the dividend income is
recurring. Read your prospectus and research reports to understand the
investment objective and strategy of the REIT.</p>
<p>Look for information under the following three key areas:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Information on the REIT manager –</strong> their experience and
track record and, if applicable, the REIT’s sponsor and pipeline of assets</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Information on properties to be put in the REIT –</strong> in particular,
whether you are familiar with the geographical and sector exposures of
the REITs you intend to invest in</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Other investment information</strong> such as dividend policy and
fees and charges</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>REITs can have different structures, geographical or sector focus, and
some REITs may carry more risks such as political and regulatory risk than
others. You should:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Read the “Investment Approach” and “Risks” portions of your prospectus
for information on the various risks of the specific REIT you intend to
invest in. Note that the risk elements may differ greatly between REITs
depending on their investment objective and strategy, geographical and
sector focus, quality of the underlying real estate properties, land&nbsp;tenure
of properties (leasehold or freehold), experience of the REIT manager and
the income distribution policy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consider if the REIT’s structure and risk profile suit your risk appetite
and investment time horizon</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not invest in a REIT if you do not understand or are not comfortable
with its investment objective and strategy</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Benefits Of REITs</h3>
<p>REITs have the following benefits:</p>
<p><strong>Diversification –</strong> The risk arising from investing in one
property is diluted when you invest in a pool of properties through a REIT.</p>
<p><strong>Affordability –</strong> As an individual investor, you may not
be able to afford a direct investment into a large asset such as office
buildings or shopping malls. By investing in a REIT, you get to invest
in these large assets in bite-size chunks.</p>
<p><strong>Liquidity –</strong> It is easier to buy and sell units in a REIT
than to buy and sell properties. REITs are listed on the stock exchange
and you can trade units in a REIT throughout the trading day.</p>
<p><strong>Tax benefits –</strong> REITs that distribute at least 90% of taxable
income each year enjoy tax transparency treatment by IRAS (subject to certain
conditions). Individual investors who receive these distributions also
enjoy tax-exemption treatment.</p>
<p><strong>Transparency and flexibility –</strong> You can access information
on REIT prices and trade REITs throughout the trading day.</p>
<h3>Investing In REITs VS Property Stocks</h3>
<p>Although both are property-related, there are some differences between
investing in REITs and investing in property stocks.</p>
<p>Most REITs have annual managers’ fees, property management fees, trustees’
fees and other expenses that will be deducted from their income before
distributions are made.</p>

<h3>Are REITS Suitable For You?</h3>
<p>Here is a checklist to help you decide whether to invest in a REIT.</p>
<h4>What Does The REIT Invest In?</h4>
<p>Read the prospectus and research reports to understand these key areas:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The sector and geographic focus (in particular the stage of property cycle
in the assets’ home countries, the economic outlook for that country, any
political or regulatory risk, any tax considerations)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The underlying assets (in particular the asset quality such as branding
of a shopping mall, occupancy rate and the tenant mix)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>How Is The REIT Structured?</h4>
<p>Read the “Investment Approach” and “Risks” portions of the prospectus
for information on the various risks of the specific REIT you intend to
invest in. Note that the risk elements may differ greatly between REITs
depending on their structure.
<br>
<br>Do also find out:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">

<p>Who are the people managing the REIT’s assets? For example, the management
quality such as its reputation and track record, its strategy for growth</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If there is a sponsor, who is the sponsor and what is the strength of
the sponsor?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are the expected fees (i.e. management fees, property management
fees, trustees’ fees, acquisition and divestment fees etc)?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the gearing (leverage) and debt maturity profile of the REIT?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are there unique features of the specific REIT which may give rise to
additional risk?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>What Are Your Rights As A REIT Unit Holder?</h4>
<p>Read the trust deed and the prospectus to understand the rights and interests
of a REIT unit holder. In general, these are limited to the right to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Require the REIT manager/ trustee to administer the REIT in accordance
with the provisions of the trust deed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remove a REIT manager</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>What Is The Distribution Policy?</h4>
<p>Find out:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>What is the expected frequency and timing of distributions from the REIT?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are the adjustments made to income in determining the amount to be
distributed?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are the circumstances under which a REIT may not make distributions,
e.g. insufficient cashflow?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Are You Comfortable With The REIT's Corporate Governance?</h4>
<p>Invest in the REIT only if you are comfortable with its corporate governance.

<h4>Does The REIT Suit Your Needs?</h4>
<p>Does the REIT’s structure and risk profile suit your risk appetite and
investment time horizon, compared with other investment options?</p>
