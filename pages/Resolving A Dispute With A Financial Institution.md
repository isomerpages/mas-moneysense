<h3>What to do if you have a dispute</h3>
<p>Disputes can happen when you don't agree with a decision made by your
financial institution or how it has dealt with your matter. These are the
recommended steps you can take to resolve the matter.</p>
<h3>Speak to your FI first</h3>
<p>You should first contact your FI so as to give it a chance to sort out
your problem and put things right.</p>
<p>Explain clearly what your issue is about and how you would like it resolved.</p>
<p>The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) expects all FIs to handle consumer
complaints and feedback promptly and effectively.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Tip: </strong>You can find your FI's contact details using this
<a href="https://eservices.mas.gov.sg/fid" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Financial Institutions Directory</a>.</p>
<h3>Approach FIDReC for assistance</h3>
<p>If you are still unable to settle the matter after contacting the FI and
trying to resolve it, you should next approach the <a href="https://www.fidrec.com.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Financial Industry Disputes Resolution Centre Ltd (FIDReC)</a>.</p>
<p>You have to do so <strong>within 6 months</strong> of receiving the final
reply from the FI to ensure that FIDReC is able to assist you.</p>
<p>FIDReC is an independent and affordable avenue for resolving problems
that cannot be settled directly with your FI. They resolve disputes relating
to banking, insurance and capital market transactions. Check with FIDReC
on the types of cases they can handle.</p>
<p>Find out more about FIDReC's <a href="https://www.fidrec.com.sg/process/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dispute Resolution Process</a> or
file a complaint with them using the <a href="https://www.fidrec.com.sg/knowledgebase/article/KA-01027/en-us" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Online Dispute Resolution Form</a>.</p>
<p>For Integrated Shield Plan (IP) claim disputes with insurers that are
of a clinical nature, you may wish to consider filing your case under the
<a href="https://www.moh.gov.sg/newsroom/new-clinical-claims-resolution-process-established-to-resolve-ip-claim-disputes" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Clinical Claims Resolution Process</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Clinical Claims Resolution Process is a voluntary process that provides
insurers, doctors, medical institutions, and policyholders an avenue for
recourse. Parties must agree to participate and abide by the decision of
the expert panel.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You have to file your case <strong>within 6 months </strong>of your insurer's
final reply to the medical practitioner, medical institution or policyholder.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Taking legal action</h3>
<p>Taking legal action should be your last resort as it can be time-consuming
and costly.</p>
<p>If you want to engage a lawyer to take legal action on your behalf, you
can search for one from the <a href="https://eservices.mlaw.gov.sg/lsra/lsra-home" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Legal Services Regulatory Authority</a>.
You can also seek the help of the <a href="https://lab.mlaw.gov.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Legal Aid Bureau</a> if you need legal aid
or advice. However, you have to meet the specific conditions before the
Legal Aid Bureau will help you.</p>
<h3>When you should report a matter to MAS</h3>
<p>MAS is unable to resolve commercial disputes between you and your FI,
such as those regarding your FI's pricing policies or contractual arrangements
with you, or order your FI to compensate you.</p>
<p>However, while you must seek to resolve the dispute with your FI, you
should report to MAS when you come across the following:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Inappropriate or misleading advice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Misrepresentation of products.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A lack of disclosure in the sales and advisory process.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You should also report to MAS when you suspect that an FI has committed
offences such as fraud, cheating, criminal breach of trust, forgery, fraudulent
accounting or corruption.</p>
<p>If you wish to report to MAS suspected wrongdoing or breaches by your
FI, you can make your report <a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/contact-us" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
