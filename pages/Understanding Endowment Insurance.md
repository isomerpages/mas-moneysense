<h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Endowment policies are bundled products, which typically require higher
premiums as they provide both investment returns and protection coverage</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bonuses projected by a participating endowment policy are not guaranteed
and may fluctuate</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A non-participating policy only provides guaranteed benefits and is not
entitled to bonuses</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prepare to commit to the period of the policy; early termination may result
in losses</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you take a loan from your cash value, it has to be repaid with interest,
making it harder for your money to grow</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Endowment insurance products are often marketed as a savings plan to help
you meet a specific financial goal, such as paying for your children’s
education, or building up a pool of savings over a fixed term.</p>
<p>But unlike deposits, you may not get back what you put in. A part of your
premiums goes towards insurance coverage, while the rest is invested and
subject to risk.</p>
<p>Endowment insurance policy is available in different forms such as:</p>
<h3>Participating Endowment Policies</h3>
<p>Participating endowment policies share in the profits of the company's
participating fund. Your share of the profit is paid in the form of bonuses
or dividends to your policy.</p>
<p>Bonuses or dividends are not guaranteed as they depend mainly on the investment
performance of the participating fund. When you make a claim, bonuses or
dividends which have been declared will be paid in addition to the sum
assured.</p>
<p>Endowment policies have cash values which will build up after a minimum
period, and this differs from product to product.</p>
<h3>Non-Participating Endowment Policies</h3>
<p>Non-participating endowment policies have guaranteed maturity values and
cash values.</p>
<h3>Anticipated Endowment Policies</h3>
<p>Anticipated endowment policies are similar to regular endowment policies
except that a part of the sum assured is paid at pre-specified intervals
during the term of the policy. The balance of the sum assured together
with the accrued bonuses (if applicable) is paid at maturity.</p>
<p>They are available as participating and non-participating policies.</p>
<h3>How Endowment Insurance Works</h3>
<p>Assess the features and risks and see if they match your needs.</p>

<h3>Things To Note</h3>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Endowment products are sometimes incorrectly marketed as fixed deposits. <strong>You may not get back what you put in</strong> as
a part of your premiums will be used to pay for the insurance coverage
or when you surrender the policy early</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Think twice before buying an endowment product to build your savings if
you do not need the insurance coverage</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compare the returns, features, and risks of the product against other
investment products in the market</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Buying a life insurance policy is a long-term commitment. Early termination
causes you to lose money. Can you afford the premium?</p>
</li>
</ul>
