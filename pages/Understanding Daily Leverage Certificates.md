<h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Daily Leverage Certificates (DLCs) are meant for short-term trades, in
particular, those settled within one day. They may not be suitable as long-term
investments</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You may get outsized returns – and losses</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>DLCs are Specified Investment Products (SIP). You may need to undergo
a Customer Account Review in order to trade DLCs</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Daily leverage certificates (DLCs) are high-risk financial products that
give investors a leveraged return based on the daily performance of an
underlying reference instrument (e.g., a securities index like the Straits
Times Index).</p>
<p>The leverage amplifies the movement of the reference instrument, thus
giving you outsized returns – and losses. DLCs may be either "long" or
"short", and allow you to bet on both the rises and falls of the reference
instrument.</p>
<p>Be familiar with the features of DLCs before trading, such as the Daily
Reset feature, Air bag feature, and impact of compounding. All investors
need to be qualified to trade in <a href="https://www.moneysense.gov.sg/understanding-specified-investment-products" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Specified Investment Products (SIP)</a> to
trade in DLCs.</p>
<h3>How It Works</h3>
<p>DLCs are meant for short-term trades, particularly those to be settled
within 1 day. They may not be suitable as long-term investments.</p>
<p>DLCs give traders a leveraged return of 3 to 7 times the daily performance
of an underlying reference instrument. So if the STI moves by 1% from its
closing price the previous day, the value of the 3x STI DLC will move by
3%, and if it is a 5x STI DLC, the value will move by 5%.</p>
<p>This means that profits and losses are both amplified although the maximum
loss for an investor is limited to the principal amount invested.</p>
<p>Other than price risks, you will be exposed to myriad risks including
the default risk of the issuer. Even if the reference instrument rises
in value, you will lose money if the issuer defaults.</p>
<h3>What's The Most You Can Lose?</h3>
<p>The maximum loss for an investor is limited to the principal amount invested.</p>
<p>DLCs are primarily for short-term traders. DLCs may appear attractive
if you are looking for the potential to make leveraged returns from the
daily movement of reference instruments such as benchmark indices. If you
plan to hold the investment for more than a day, note that gains and losses
will be compounded and costs and fees will apply.
<br>
<br>You should only consider trading DLCs if you have a very high tolerance
for risk and are willing to run the risk of losing of all the capital invested.
<br>
<br>As DLCs are for speculative and short-term trades, they may not be suitable
as long-term investments.</p>
<h3>Returns from DLCs</h3>
<p>Calculating your returns can be complex. These features of a DLC will
impact the returns, namely: &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<div data-type="detailGroup" class="isomer-accordion isomer-accordion-white">
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary>Leverage</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Leverage amplifies the returns and losses. DLCs offer a fixed leveraged
return of 3 to 7 times of the daily performance of the underlying reference
instrument, be it a rising or falling market.</p>
<p>For example, if the STI moves by 1% from its closing price the previous
day, the value of the 3xSTI DLC by move by 3%.</p>
</div>
</details>
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary>Daily reset feature</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>The price of a DLC will be reset at the start of each trading day, based
on the closing level of its reference instrument the day before.</p>
<p>If you hold the product for more than one day, DLC will not reflect the
performance of the underlying reference instrument as compounding and resets
may affect the value of the DLC.</p>
</div>
</details>
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary>Air bag feature</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>This mechanism will only be triggered if the underlying reference index
moves against the direction of the product. It acts to reduce the amount
of loss in the value of a DLC during extreme market conditions. Here is
how the air bag works:</p>
<p>Each DLC will have a pre-set trigger for its air bag. For example:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>For a 5x DLC on a securities index, the air bag should trigger when its
underlying reference index falls by 10%</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For a 3x DLC on a securities index, the air bag should trigger when its
underlying reference index falls by 20% (based on the closing price of
the unferlying reference index in the previous trading day).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When the air bag is triggered:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Trading of the DLC will be suspended for at least 30 minutes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During this time, the underlying reference instrument will be re-set to
a minimum observed level (MOL)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The MOL will then form the new base level</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>By re-valuing the DLC at the new base level, the movements in the underlying
reference instrument will have a disproportionately smaller effect on the
value of the DLC.</p>
<p><strong>Limitations of the air bag</strong>
</p>
<p>The air bag can work against you if the underlying reference instrument
quickly rebounds in value after it is triggered. It will lock in the loss
sustained prior to the suspension of the DLC's trading, and subsequent
gains will then be applied to the MOL instead of the level that the underlying
reference instrument has rebounded to.</p>
<p>The air bag will not prevent you from losing your entire investment where
the leveraged movement of the underlying reference instrument exceeds the
value of the DLC.</p>
<p>For example, a 5x DLC on a securities index (with an air bag that is set
to trigfger if the underlying reference index falls by 10%) will become
worthless if its underlying reference index suffers a sharp fall of 20%
or more in the course of a trading day, or at opening of a trading day
due to overnight movements.</p>
</div>
</details>
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary>Daily premium feature</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>A premium is deducted from the DLC at the close of trading each day. The
premium is used by the issuer to hedge against extremem movements in the
undrelying reference index that take place overnight.</p>
<p>This means that while you can lose your entire investment, you will not
lose any more than that (which is a concern for many leveraged products).</p>
<p>You do not pay the premium if you close your position prior to the end
of the trading day.</p>

</table>
<p>Note that the <strong>air bag</strong> mechanism has the following risks:</p>
<p><strong>May reduce the ability for the product to recoup losses </strong>–
When triggered, the air bag reduces your exposure to the underlying instrument.
Your gains or losses could be restricted in relation to the movement of
the underlying instrument.</p>
<p><strong>May not prevent total loss of investment </strong>– The air bag
will not prevent you from losing the entire value of your investment, in
any event of:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>An extreme overnight fall (for a long DLC) or rise (for a short DLC) in
the underlying reference instrument, where the difference between the previous
day’s closing level and the next day’s opening level of the underlying
instrument is 20% or greater for a 5x DLC on a securities index (100%/leverage
factor). This is because the air bag will only be triggered after the market
opens the next day</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A sharp intraday fall (for a long DLC) or rise (for a short DLC) in the
underlying instrument of the same percentage or greater during the observation
period.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Role Of Market-Makers</h3>
<p>There will be market makers to provide bid and ask prices. However, there
are circumstances where the market maker may not provide quotations. These
include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>During the pre-market opening and 5 minutes following the opening of the
SGX on any trading day</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the DLCs are valueless (where the Issuer’s bid price is below the minimum
bid size) the market maker will not provide the bid price, but only provide
the offer price</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where the reference instrument is a securities index, when trading in
the shares or securities relating to the underlying reference index is
suspended or limited in a material way</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where the DLCs are suspended from trading</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the underlying market for the respective DLC is closed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Market disruption events</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where the Issuer or the DMM faces technical problems affecting the ability
of the DMM to provide bids and offer quotations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where the Issuer is unable to hedge or unwind a hedge, because of prevailing
market conditionsIn cases where the Issuer has no DLCs to sell, the market
maker will only provide the bid price.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the stock market experiences exceptional price movement and volatility.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>DLCs will be open for trading during SGX market trading hours (9.00am
to 5.00pm). However the designated market maker would not quote in the
market if the underlying market of the respective DLCs is closed</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Things To Note</h3>
<p>Other features of DLCs include the following:</p>
<p><strong>Limited lifespan –</strong> DLCs have a limited life with a maximum
tenure of three years.</p>
<p><strong>Delisting –</strong> A DLC will be delisted upon maturity, or upon
the issuer's request because the DLC has lost all its value due to extreme
market movements.</p>
<p><strong>Adjustments for corporate actions on underlying securities –</strong> If
the underlying reference instrument of a DLC is a share of a corporation,
the DLC issuer may make adjustments to the DLC if the issuer of the underlying
shares undertakes a corporate action (such as a bonus issue).</p>
<p>If so, the DLC issuer will determine whether the corporate action has
a dilutive or concentrative effect on the value of the underlying shares,
It will then adjust the leveraged return of the underlying shares to preserve
the economic equivalent value of the DLC and determine the effective date
of that adjustment.</p>
<h3>Costs And Fees</h3>
<p>Note that DLCs have fees and charges you need to factor in, including:</p>
<p><strong>Brokerage and spread –</strong> If you trade in and out of a DLC,
you will pay a brokerage commission and SGX trading fee to your broker,
as well as the Bid &amp; Ask spread.</p>
<p><strong>Management fee –</strong> If you hold your position overnight,
you will be charged the management fee. This is charged daily. Check the
relevant daily rates on the product issuer’s website.</p>
<p><strong>Premium –</strong> A premium payable for the hedging cost. The
hedge is to limit your risk from extreme market movements overnight and
ensures that you cannot lose more than what you have invested. If you buy
and sell the DLC within the same day, you do not need to pay the premium.</p>
<p><strong>Funding cost and rebalancing cost –</strong> These costs are charged
to the DLC overnight and reduce the value of the DLC each time you hold
the DLC overnight. More information on these costs can be found in the
issuer‘s listing documents. If the investment for more than a day, note
that gains and losses will be compounded and costs and fees will apply.</p>
