<p>It’s always nice to start afresh for a new year. That’s why we make promises
to ourselves to change a habit or start one, in order to become a better
version of ourselves.</p>
<p>But New Year’s resolutions are notoriously tricky – studies show only
roughly 10% of people keep up.</p>
<p>For the rest of us, we’re still trying to convince ourselves that this
year is really, really, really going to be different.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And it actually could be, with the help of these simple tips:</p>
<h3>Accept That Things Will Not Be Perfect</h3>
<p>Anyone can slip up. But when you do, bear in mind that missing the mark
on the odd day won’t derail your plan for the year.</p>
<p>In fact, as long as the days you kept to your plan outnumber those where
you didn’t, it’s fair to say you’re one step closer to your improved self.</p>
<h3>Focus On What You’re Doing Differently</h3>
<p>Letting go is not easy. Less so is trying new things.</p>
<p>So instead of reminding yourself every day not to eat that bag of potato
chips, start the day planning how you’re going to fit in that gym session
or which new salad to try.</p>
<h3>Use Present-Tense, And Specify</h3>
<p>Instead of saying “I will save every month”, say “I put aside $250 every
time my salary comes in”.</p>
<p>It frames the target as an established practice and is a subtle way of
tricking your brain against weaselling out.</p>
<h3>Tell Someone About Your Plans</h3>
<p>By sharing your targets with someone — a supportive person who knows what
keeps you ticking when you are in need of motivation — it’s less likely
you’ll lapse unnoticed.</p>
<p>Better yet, if you have a buddy who shares the same resolution as you,
all the better as you can spur each other on.</p>
<h3>Celebrate Milestones</h3>
<p>If there’s something to look forward to at checkpoints towards a long-term
goal, you’ll more likely have more motivation to press on.</p>
<p>For instance, if you had aimed to save more money, treat yourself to indulgences
like a nice meal, a new dress, or tech gizmo when you cross certain thresholds.</p>
<p>These tips are not only effective, they are easy to remember and put into
practice.</p>
<p>If you’ve drawn up a list of resolutions, you can incorporate these to
make the journey to a better you more positive and enjoyable. If you haven’t
— or did not include personal finance resolutions — maybe these suggestions
could come in handy.</p>
<p><strong>Tip: </strong>Set resolutions that are fun so that you're not
constantly reminded that you're trying to change a habit.</p>
<h4>1. Save For Your Retirement</h4>
<p>If you haven’t started planning for your retirement, start now. Yes, this
resolution is not specific, but it’s intentional.</p>
<p>Not scare-mongering but with each passing year, you are one year closer
to retirement.</p>
<p>It may be daunting to think of how much you’ll need, but while you work
that out, start saving, even if it’s just a little.</p>
<h4>2. Don’t Spend Any $5 Note You Get</h4>
<p>By the end of the year, you’ll probably have hundreds, and all from a
little game you play. The money could pay your insurance premium.</p>
<p>You could take your family out for a meal. Or you could splash it on a
vacation.</p>
<p>Point is, this simple personal challenge is a painless way to etch into
your brain the virtue — and pleasures — of saving.</p>
<h4>3. Top Up Your CPF Every January</h4>
<p>No matter how much you deposit into your CPF, know that you’re getting
a better interest rate (currently, you get up to 5%) than with any savings
account.</p>
<p>You can deposit up to $7,000 a year into your own account, so doing it
in January earns you more in interest.</p>
<p>The additional perk: You get tax relief on your top-up amount.</p>
<h4>4. Make Yourself Spend Nothing For Two Weeks</h4>
<p>It’s an effective and efficient way to reset your attitudes. You’ll think
about your consumption habits. You’ll learn about yourself. And you’ll
save some money.</p>
<p>Once you get the hang of it, maybe you can do it every quarter just as
some would occasionally go on a detox diet.</p>
<h4>5. Generate An Alternative Stream Of Income</h4>
<p>Again, the amount is not the nub of the experiment. Instead, it’s to learn
about how you can grow your income.</p>
<p>It may be from a small side business, or investing in the stock market.</p>
<h4>6. Use Your Pay Raise To Reach Your Financial Goals</h4>
<p>Your pay raise is actually worth more than you think, since your expenses
are unlikely to grow that much year on year.</p>
<p>Automate a transfer of your raise amount out of your salary crediting
account on each month’s payday into a savings account, and work out how
best to exploit the additional money.</p>
<p>You may be able to pay off an extra month’s mortgage for the year, or
clear your debt, or use it for investing.</p>
<h4>7. Learn About One Asset Class Every Three Months</h4>
<p>Let’s face it, many of us say we don’t know enough to start investing.
And that will never change if you don’t start learning.</p>
<p>Be realistic, though. If you haven’t started reading up on investing,
you should give yourself ample time to digest the information.</p>
