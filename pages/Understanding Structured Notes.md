<h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Most structured notes are not principal-guaranteed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be prepared to have your money tied up for a set period of time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Redeeming your investment before maturity may not be possible, or could
come with substantial cost</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>What Are Structured Notes?</h3>
<p>A structured note is a debt product whose return is linked to the performance
of one or more underlying assets or benchmarks. It may be the interest
that is payable on the structured note and/or the principal repayment,
that is linked to the performance of the asset or benchmark.</p>
<p>A structure note is a complex product and there are other factors which
can affect its performance. For example:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The credit risk of the issuer as well as the credit risk of various counterparties
of the issuer</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Changes in the value of any collateral provided</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If the asset or benchmark underperforms, you may suffer a loss on your
returns or even principal invested.</p>
<p>While some structured notes may attempt to preserve the value of the capital
invested by providing collateral, there is no guarantee that the principal
amount invested will be returned to you.</p>
<p>It is important that you read and understand the Product Highlights Sheet
and Prospectus to understand the product’s features and risks.</p>
<h3>Structured Note VS Structured Deposit</h3>
<p>Structured note investors may potentially lose the whole amount invested
in a structured note. But if you invest in a structured deposit, you will
at least receive the principal amount deposited on the maturity of the
structured deposits (subject to the credit risk of the bank).</p>
<h3>Underlying Assets Or Benchmarks</h3>
<p>The underlying assets or benchmarks are sometimes referred to as reference
assets or reference benchmarks.</p>
<p>These assets or benchmarks may include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Market indices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Equities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Interest rates</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixed-income products</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Foreign exchange rates</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Commodities prices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any combination of these</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There are also structured notes with returns linked to two or more reference
assets or benchmarks (for example, the interest amount and/or principal
repayment are dependent on both the creditworthiness and the share price
of a group of companies).</p>
<h3>Types Of Structured Notes</h3>

<h3>Returns From Structured Notes</h3>
<p>A structured note is a debt obligation of the issuer of the structured
note. The issuer of the structured note usually pays interest or returns
to investors during the term of the notes.</p>
<p>The interest paid may be a fixed coupon or calculated according to a formula
which is linked to one or more underlying reference asset(s) or benchmark(s).</p>
<p>Read the Product Highlights Sheet and Prospectus carefully to understand
the conditions affecting interest or principal payments. Ask questions
and ensure that you understand the information in the documents before
deciding whether to invest in the structured note.</p>
<h3>Why Invest In Structured Notes?</h3>
<p>Structured notes often offer investors potential returns that are higher
than interest rates offered on traditional deposits. They may even offer
the potential for capital appreciation.</p>
<p>But such returns or capital gains are dependent on the performance of
the underlying reference asset(s) or benchmark(s), which in turn exposes
the investor to a greater variety of risks than a traditional deposit would.</p>
<h3>What Are The Risks?</h3>
<p>An investor will lose money if:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The underlying asset or benchmark underperforms, e.g., if the price, value
or level of the underlying asset or benchmark does not move in the direction
and/or by an amount sufficient to produce a return under the structured
note</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The issuer of the structured note defaults on its commitments under the
structured note</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Structured notes are usually embedded with derivatives such as options
or swaps. These instruments provide the link between the note’s overall
return and the performance of the underlying reference asset or benchmark.</p>
<p>While structured notes may offer higher potential returns, the investor
takes on greater risks when investing in such products. The swap or option
involves a contract between the issuer of the structured note and another
institution (the counterparty).</p>
<p>Risks arising from the derivative instruments, including the failure of
a counterparty to meet its obligations, may be passed on directly to the
investor and may result in the total loss of the original investment amount.</p>
<h3>What’s The Most You Can Lose?</h3>
<p><strong>Most structured notes are not principal-guaranteed.</strong> You
may lose all or a substantial amount of the money you invested in certain
situations, which are described in the Product Highlights Sheet and Prospectus.</p>
<p>The principal repayment or the interest payable, or both may be linked
to the performance of an underlying asset or benchmark. If the asset or
benchmark underperforms, you may suffer a loss on your returns and the
principal invested.</p>
<p>Your return may also be affected if your structured note is redeemed early
by the issuer, or for other reasons specified in the prospectus for the
structured note.</p>
<h3>Early Redemption</h3>
<p>Many structured notes allow the issuer to redeem or “call” the notes before
maturity. When this happens, the notes would normally be redeemed in full.</p>
<p>If an early redemption takes place, you may face reinvestment risk and
loss if you are unable to reinvest the principal received at equally attractive
returns.</p>
<p>The structured notes may also be redeemed early if:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>There is an event of default e.g. if the issuer fails to meet payment
obligations under the structured note</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Taxes are imposed on the issuer or on payments from the note</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An extraordinary or force majeure event occurs (these are described in
the prospectus for the note)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The market value of any collateral falls and is insufficient to secure
any or all obligations under the structured note.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In these circumstances, you may lose all or part of the amount you initially
invested.</p>
<h3>Fees And Charges</h3>
<p>The issuer may charge a fee for the management of the reference assets
of the structured note and for the hedging of the risks relating to the
changes in value of such assets.</p>
<p>A list of all such fees and expenses, which are usually payable out of
the returns generated by the reference assets, should be disclosed in the
prospectus for the structured note.</p>
<p>If the structured note is traded on an exchange, the trading of the note
will incur clearing and trading fees, as well as commission fees imposed
by individual brokers.</p>
<h3>Documents You Should Receive</h3>
<p>If you are offered a structured note, you should receive a prospectus
and Product Highlights Sheet.</p>
<h4>Prospectus</h4>
<p>Issuers who offer structured notes to retail investors are required to
provide a prospectus to investors. Read the prospectus carefully to understand
the details of the offer, information on the issuer, risk factors, and
the terms and conditions of the structured notes.</p>
<h4>Product Highlights Sheet</h4>
<p>In addition to the prospectus, the issuer should also provide you with
a Product Highlights Sheet. The Product Highlights Sheet is a short document
which highlights key features and risks of the structured notes, and usually
incorporates diagrams such as graphs and flowcharts to explain the structure
or payoffs of the structured notes.</p>
<p>The Product Highlights Sheet does not replace the prospectus. It is important
to read the prospectus before deciding whether to purchase the product.</p>
<h4>Checklist</h4>
<p>Investing in structured notes may not be for everyone. Before you invest,
check that you:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Want potentially higher returns but are also <strong>prepared for variable returns</strong> which
include the risk of losing all or a substantial part of the money you invested</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Understand how the returns are calculated</strong> or are clear
about the factors and scenarios that can affect returns</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Understand the risks associated with the structured note.</strong> Structured
notes may use derivatives to hedge risks or to improve performance. Investors
should be aware of the risks associated with the use of derivatives, including
the risk that the provider or counterparty of the derivative defaults</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Understand the full extent of the credit risks</strong> associated
with the issuer, as well as risks associated with any assets referenced
in the note</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Are prepared to leave your money tied up</strong> until the maturity
date of the note or do not have short term needs for the money</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Are prepared for your investment to be redeemed earlier,</strong> whether
at the issuer’s option or for other specified reasons. An early redemption
of the structured note may result in you losing all or part of your original
investment</p>
</li>
</ul>
