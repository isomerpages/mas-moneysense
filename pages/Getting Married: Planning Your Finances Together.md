<p><strong>Do not let money put a strain on your relationship. Find out how you can work together to achieve your financial goals as a couple.</strong>
</p>
<h4>Working On Your New Financial Life Together</h4>
<hr>
<p>One of the most important parts of a marriage is knowing how to manage
your money together.</p>
<p>Differing attitudes towards money can pose challenges to a relationship.
For example, what seems sensible and prudent to you may seem stingy to
him or her. If you are used to lavishing each other with extravagant gifts,
you might no longer find this desirable or sensible once you get married
and have bills to pay.</p>
<p>Planning ahead together can help you build a strong foundation for your
marriage.</p>
<h4>What You Should Do</h4>
<hr>
<p>Here are some tips for you:</p>
<h4>1. Learn Each Other's Spending Habits</h4>
<p>Find out each other's style of managing money, and adapt to each other.
If your partner is a spender, agree on some limits. Make your expectations
clear and find some common ground.</p>
<h4>2. Draw Up A Budget Together</h4>
<p>Make extra effort to draw up a joint budget. This will help you track
how your salaries are being spent, and find ways to improve your finances.</p>
<h4>3. Share Expenses And Save For Common Goals</h4>
<p>Find a way to share your household expenses and save for your emergency
funds and retirement.</p>
<p>Agree on each personâ€™s contribution, it may be in proportion to the income.
For example, one person could be servicing the home loan while the other
could be paying the bills.</p>
<h4>4. Set Goals And Work Towards Them</h4>
<p>After setting your financial goals, take responsibility to live within
your means. You might be a young couple now starting out with promising
careers, but one day you may stop working when kids come along, or to take
care of elderly parents. Expenses will also go up as your family grows.
So do plan and save up early.</p>
<h4>5. Avoid Impulse Spending Or Borrowing</h4>
<p>Do not make large financial commitments on your own or on impulse. Instead,
discuss them with your spouse first.</p>
<h4>6. Sort Out The Important Things First</h4>
<p>As you move on to the next stage of life, it's also time to review your
health and life insurance.</p>
