Partnering MoneySense: for schools, workplaces and communities

MoneySense invites you to partner us to bring financial literacy education to various segments of the population.

Find out how we can work together to help consumers acquire the knowledge and skills to manage their finances, make prudent financial decisions, and plan for their longer term needs.  

### Talks for employees and community groups

The MoneySense–Singapore Polytechnic Institute for Financial Literacy (IFL) offers free talks and workshops on basic money management, financial planning, and personal investing.

The institute can also conduct free talks or workshops at your premises.

If you're interested in arranging for a talk or workshops, you may get in touch with IFL via the "Contact Us" form on the [IFL website](https://ifl.org.sg/).

### For schools:  Updates

As announced to schools in March 2023, we will be **discontinuing the co-funding of financial literacy workshops for schools under the IES with effect from 30 June 2023.**

For schools which had planned to apply for co-funding for financial literacy workshops under IES this year, please submit your completed applications

- within three months of the end-date of the financial literacy workshop OR
