<p><strong>Return</strong>
</p>
</td>

<p><strong>Sharpe Ratio</strong>
</p>
</td>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">

taken.</p>

<p><strong>Inception Date</strong>
</p>
</td>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">

</p>
</td>

</tr>

<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p><strong>Volatility</strong>
</p>
</td>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">

<p><strong>Active Share</strong>
</p>
</td>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">

exactly the same holdings as the benchmark will have an active share of
0%.</p>

<p><strong>Tracking Error</strong>
</p>
</td>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">

passive fund's returns closely followed that of the benchmark.&nbsp;</p>
</td>

<h3><strong>Changes In Strategy Or Approach</strong></h3>
<p>In addition, while a fund’s investment objective may not change, the actual
investment approach or strategy deployed may change.</p>
<p>Changes in the top 10 holdings of the fund (as shown in the fund’s periodic
reports) could indicate that the investment approach or strategy has changed.
If you notice that the fund’s holdings do not correspond with its stated
investment objective, find out why.
<br>
<br>Watch out for <a href="https://team.dms.mas.gov.sg/sites/csi/consEdn/MoneySense%20Website/MS%202023%20Website%20Archive/Offline%20Website/MON-241-PRD/www.moneysense.gov.sg/articles/2018/10/understanding-unit-trusts.html#evaluating-a-funds-performance" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">how the fund performs</a> compared
to its benchmarks. Make sure you understand the charts provided as well
as their limitations. For example, if performance appears to be exceptional
over certain periods but not other periods, find out why.</p>
<h2><strong>The Bottom Line</strong></h2>
<p>Look out for the key information in a fund's prospectus, product highlights
sheet and regular reports. They contain a wealth of information that will
help you make informed investment decisions, both before and after you
buy.</p>
