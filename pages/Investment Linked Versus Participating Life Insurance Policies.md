<h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Investment-Linked Policies (ILPs) and participating life insurance policies
both have investment components</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ILPs do not have any guaranteed cash value, while participating policies
have a portion that is guaranteed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With ILPs, you bear all the investment risk</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Both investment-linked insurance policies (ILPs) and other life insurance
policies with cash value, such as participating whole life and endowment
policies, have investment components.</p>
<p>However, there are important differences between the two. Use this table
to compare the two types:</p>
<p>Insurers may choose to smoothen bonuses to avoid large fluctuations in
bonus declared year on year.</p>
<p>This means that the returns from your policy will not necessarily track
the ups and downs of investment markets.</p>
