<h2>Investing In SGX-listed Shares</h2>
<p>You can invest in shares of a company seeking a listing on the <a href="http://sgx.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Singapore Exchange (SGX)</a> through
its Initial Public Offering (IPO).</p>
<p>You can also invest in shares of companies that are already listed on
the SGX through a broker. On the SGX, shares are mostly traded in board
lots of 100. If a share is priced at $1, you pay $100 to invest in one
lot of shares (excluding transaction costs).</p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>Some investors use margin financing when trading
shares. Leverage trading can be risky and can lead to unlimited losses
depending on the positions taken.</p>

</p>
<h3>Before You Invest</h3>
<p>With so many shares to choose from, it pays to do your due diligence.
Take the time to do your research and shortlist companies that meet your
criteria. To buy and sell shares, you will need a Central Depository (CDP)
account and a trading account with a brokerage firm.</p>
<p>Find out more about the process.</p>
<h4>Decide On Which Shares To Invest In</h4>
<p>Be clear about your investment objectives first, that is, whether you
are building up capital or looking for income. Also, know how much risk
you are prepared to take. Build an investment portfolio that is diversified
to achieve your desired risk-return profile. Decide on how you want to
allocate your capital. This will help you narrow down your search.</p>
<p>Investors may use fundamental analysis or technical analysis or a mixture
of both when deciding which shares to invest in.
<br>
<br>Before investing, make sure you are familiar with the company including
its business operations, whether it has a steady growth outlook, the industry
it is in, its financial performance, corporate governance, whether there
are any weaknesses and other factors which could affect its performance
and share price.</p>
<h4>Do Your Due Diligence</h4>
<p>Want to participate in an IPO? Take time to read the prospectus carefully
to understand the company including its business operations, vulnerabilities,
financial performance, valuation and corporate governance.</p>
<p>Likewise, before investing in shares of a listed company, find out more
about the listed company and its performance by reading its annual reports,
corporate announcements and other disclosures.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned information can be found at:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The company’s website</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.sgx.com/wps/portal/sgxweb/home/company_disclosure/company_announcements" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">SGX’s website</a>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://eservices.mas.gov.sg/opera/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">MAS OPERA</a> -
for prospectuses of share offerings</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Open A CDP And Trading Account</h4>
<p>Before you can start trading, you will need two accounts:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Securities account with the <a href="https://www1.cdp.sgx.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Central Depository</a>  <a href="https://www1.cdp.sgx.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">(CDP)</a> - this
holds all the shares you will buy on SGX and electronically records the
transactions as they happen</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trading account with a stock brokerage - this allows you to trade shares
in the stock market</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Both these accounts have to be linked before you can start trading.</p>
<h4>Fees And Charges</h4>
<p>You would need to pay brokerage commission to your broker. The commission
is usually based on a percentage of the investment amount.</p>
<p>In addition to brokerage commissions and other charges imposed by brokers,
there is a CDP clearing fee and SGX trading access fee. Please note that
GST is payable on all fees.</p>
<h3>After You Invest</h3>
<p>As a shareholder, you should:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Monitor your investments regularly</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Take note of any corporate actions that the listed company intends to
take and how these can affect you</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vote in resolutions seeking shareholders’ approval, either at a general
meeting or by proxy</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Monitor Your Shares</h4>
<p>You can get live trading prices from the SGX website.
<br>
<br>There are on-going disclosure requirements if the shares are listed on
SGX. Under SGX Listing Rules, companies are required to announce all material
information via SGXNET. Companies are also required to announce their full-year
and interim financial results.
<br>
<br>Your broker may also provide research and analysis on the shares you are
interested in.
<br>
<br>Do keep track of the company’s performance, its business and the performance
of the industry it operates in. You can do this by:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Reading the news</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keeping up with the company’s announcements and other disclosures to the
public, including interim financial statements, annual reports, shareholders’
circulars or other documents</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Track Corporate Actions</h4>
<p>You should also keep track of corporate actions such as bonus or rights
issues and share buybacks. As a shareholder, you should find out how these
corporate actions will affect you.</p>
<p>Visit the <a href="http://sgx.com/wps/portal/sgxweb/home/company_disclosure/company_announcements" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">SGX website</a> to
find company announcements and circulars for any of the company's proposed
corporate actions.</p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>Companies may request a trading halt or suspension
when disseminating material information to the investors.</p>
<h4>Attend General Meetings And Vote</h4>
<p>As an ordinary shareholder, you have a right to attend and vote at general
meetings on matters such as major acquisitions or disposals, or the appointment
of directors.</p>
<p>A general meeting provides a forum for you to engage the company’s board
or senior management and voice your views on matters affecting the company.</p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>Your vote counts – cast your votes for resolutions
seeking shareholders’ approval by voting in person at a general meeting
or by proxy.</p>
<h4>Concerns About An SGX-listed Company</h4>
<p>If you are a shareholder and have some concerns about the company’s compliance
with SGX’s listing rules, or about possible market misconduct, you may
wish to <a href="https://www.sgx.com/contact-us" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">contact SGX</a>.</p>
<p>SGX is the frontline regulator of listed companies and is required to
administer a sound regulatory framework to maintain a fair, orderly and
informed market.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you may wish to make your views known at the company’s
Annual General Meeting.</p>
<h3>Key Questions To Ask Before Investing In Shares</h3>
<p>Consider the suitability of an investment in shares in light of your own
circumstances. In particular, you should consider whether you:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Have sufficient knowledge and experience to make a meaningful evaluation
of the merits and risks of investing in shares</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have access to and knowledge of appropriate analytical tools to evaluate
the investment in the shares and how such investment will impact your overall
investment portfolio</p>
</li>
<li>

of investing in shares, including the risk of losing all or a substantial
part of your investment</p>
</li>

of a financial advisor) changes in market, economic or other conditions
that may affect the issuer or trading in the shares</p>
</li>
