<h2><strong>What it is</strong></h2>
<p>Exchange traded funds (ETFs) are investment funds that are listed and
traded on a stock exchange. Your money is pooled with money from other
investors and invested according to the ETF's stated investment objective.</p>
<h2><strong>How it works</strong></h2>
<p>An ETF typically aims to produce a return that tracks or replicates a
specific index such as a stock index or commodity index.</p>
<p>Such index tracking ETFs are passively managed by ETF managers and do
not try to outperform the underlying index. Index tracking ETFs have fees
and charges that are usually lower than those of actively managed investment
funds.</p>
<p>ETFs may have complex structures. They may be structured as cash-based
ETFs or as synthetic ETFs, which involve the use of derivatives.
<br>
<br><strong>Note:</strong> Many ETFs have been categorised as <a href="https://team.dms.mas.gov.sg/sites/csi/consEdn/MoneySense%20Website/MS%202023%20Website%20Archive/Offline%20Website/MON-241-PRD/www.moneysense.gov.sg/articles/2018/11/understanding-specified-investment-products-sips.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Specified Investment Products (SIPs)</a>.
You will need to meet certain requirements to invest in them. Check with
your financial institution whether the product you are considering is an
SIP.</p>
<h2><strong>Returns of ETFs</strong></h2>
<p>You invest in an ETF by buying units in the ETF. There is capital gain
when the price of the units rises above the price paid for them. Some ETFs
also pay dividends.</p>
<h2><strong>What’s the most you can lose?</strong></h2>
<p>ETFs are not principal-guaranteed. You may lose all or a substantial amount
of the money you invested in certain situations. The risks of investing
in ETFs are described in the prospectus and product highlights sheet.</p>
<h2><strong>Why invest in ETFs?</strong></h2>
<p>There are many ETFs to choose from. If you buy an ETF which tracks a stock
index, you gain exposure to the performance of the index. For example,
investing in an ETF that tracks the Straits Times Index (STI) provides
investors with exposure to the Singapore market.</p>
<p>Here are a few advantages of investing in an ETF:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>You can gain exposure to an index without having to invest in all its
component stocks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fees and charges tend to be lower than for actively managed investment
funds, as ETFs have lower management fees. There is also usually no sales
charge, although if you buy and sell <a href="https://api2.sgx.com/sites/default/files/2018-11/SGX%20ETF%20Investor%20Guide%20(Nov%202018).pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ETFs on the SGX</a>,
you would need to pay the applicable brokerage commissions or transfer
taxes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As ETFs are traded on a stock exchange, you can buy and sell units of
ETFs throughout the trading day</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Checklist</strong></h3>
<h2><strong>Are ETFs suitable for you?</strong></h2>
<p>Investing in ETFs may not be for everyone. Before you invest, make sure
that you:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Want potentially higher returns BUT are also prepared for variable returns
which include the risk of losing all or a substantial part of your investment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Understand how returns are calculated and the factors that can affect
returns.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Understand the risks associated with the ETF.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You should be aware of the risks associated with the use of derivatives
by ETFs, including the consequences if the provider or counterparty of
the derivative defaults.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are prepared to have your money tied up for long periods of time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A longer time horizon is generally preferred to ride out short-term price
fluctuations. But depending on the investor’s investment objective, some
ETFs may be suitable for short term trading.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are familiar with the ETF manager and the ETF’s track record.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>What are the risks?</strong></h2>
<p>Common risks associated with ETFs include the following</p>

<h2><strong>Types of ETFs: Cash-based vs. synthetic</strong></h2>
<p>There are different ways to structure an ETF even if its investment objective
is to track the same underlying index.</p>
<h3><strong>Cash-based ETF</strong></h3>
<p>Cash-based (or physical) ETFs are ETFs that invest directly into the assets
that make up the index. They may invest in:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>All of the index’s component stocks, bonds or assets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A representative selection of the index’s component stocks, bonds or assets.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Synthetic ETF</strong></h3>
<p>Synthetic ETFs are ETFs that use derivative products such as swaps or
access products (for example, participatory notes) to produce returns that
track the relevant indices.</p>
<p>The use of derivatives means:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>More parties are involved, e.g. the swap counterparty or the access product
issuer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You are exposed to the risk that the swap counterparty or access product
issuer defaults on its payment obligations under the swap or access product.
Such a party may default if it becomes bankrupt or insolvent. The amount
of loss you suffer will depend on the ETF’s exposure to the counterparty
or issuer.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Synthetic ETFs that are swap-based may use either the unfunded or funded
structure.</p>
