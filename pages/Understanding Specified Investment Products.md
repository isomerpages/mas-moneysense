<h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>There are certain more complex retail investment products that are classified
as Specified Investment Products (SIPs)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you want to buy and sell SIPs listed on an exchange, you need to go
through a Customer Account Review before opening an account</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you want to buy and sell SIPs that are not listed on an exchange, you
similarly need to get through a Customer Knowledge Assessment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is to assess that investors have the knowledge or experience to assess
an SIP's complex features before they invest</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>What Are SIPs?</h3>
<p>SIPs are generally products that are more complex than others. For example,
they may contain derivatives, which can expose you to more factors that
may affect your investment, or have returns or losses determined by complicated
formulas.</p>
<p>Hence, you should have some prior financial knowledge or experience in
order to make an informed investment decision.</p>
<p>To help retail investors, the Monetary Authority of Singapore has classified
certain investments as SIPs, and requires financial institutions to assess
the investor's investment knowledge and experience before selling SIPs
to the investor. This is to assess that investors have the relevant knowledge
and experience to understand the features and risks associated with investing
in such products, before they invest.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Types Of SIPs</h3>
<p>There are generally two types of SIPs - those that are <strong>listed</strong> on
an exchange and those that are <strong>unlisted</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Tip: </strong>On the SGX website, SIPs are marked with an "@"
prefix.</p>
<h3>What Is Required</h3>
<p>Financial institutions are required to formally assess your investment
knowledge and experience before selling SIPs to you. This is to ensure
that you have the relevant knowledge and experience to understand the features
and risks associated with investing in such products.</p>
<p>It is not the same as the suitability assessment which considers your
risk appetite.</p>
<p>You will need to go through a Customer Account Review for listed SIPs,
or a Customer Knowledge Assessment for unlisted SIPs.</p>
<h4>Customer Account Review</h4>
<p>Before you can open an account to trade listed SIPs, the financial institution
must conduct a Customer Account Review.</p>
<p>The financial institution will request information on your educational
qualifications, investment experience, and work experience. They will use
it to assess whether you meet at least one of the following criteria:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Have the relevant educational qualifications</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have a professional finance-related qualification</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have a minimum of 3 consecutive years of relevant working experience in
the past 10 years</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have made at least 6 transactions in listed SIPs in the last 3 years</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have completed the free learning module from SGX Online Education Programme
and passed the assessment at the end of it</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You can find out the outcome of the Customer Account Review from the financial
institution.</p>
<h4>How Long It Is Valid For</h4>
<p>The outcome of your Customer Account Review will expire after 3 years
if you have transacted in a listed SIP only once or not at all during that
period. If so, the financial institution will be required to conduct a
new Customer Account Review before you can transact in any listed SIP.</p>
<h4>Customer Knowledge Assessment</h4>
<p>If you wish to transact in an unlisted SIP, the financial institution
must conduct a Customer Knowledge Assessment.</p>
<p>The financial institution will request information on your educational
qualifications, investment experience, and work experience. They will use
it to assess whether you meet at least one of the following criteria:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Have the relevant educational qualifications</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have a professional finance-related qualification</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have a minimum of 3 consecutive years of relevant working experience in
the past 10 years</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have made at least 6 transactions in unlisted SIPs in the last 3 years.
Transactions include buying unlisted SIPs or topping up your investment
in an unlisted SIP</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have completed the free learning modules from ABS-SAS e-learning portal
on SIPs and passed the assessment at the end of it</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You can find out the outcome of the Customer Knowledge Assessment from
the financial institution.</p>
<p>Even if you meet the Customer Knowledge Assessment criteria, remember
that you can always ask the financial institution for advice on whether
an unlisted SIP is suitable for you.</p>
<h4>How Long It Is Valid For</h4>
<p>The outcome of your Customer Knowledge Assessment is only valid for a
year.</p>
<p>After the one year, the financial institution will be required to conduct
a fresh Customer Knowledge Assessment regardless of the number of transactions
in unlisted SIPs you have made in that period, before you can transact
in an unlisted SIP. This is to ensure that your knowledge and experience
continue to be relevant.</p>
<h3>Trading Both Listed And Unlisted SIPs</h3>
<p>If you want to buy both listed and unlisted SIPs, you will be asked to
go through both a Customer Account Review and a Customer Knowledge Assessment.</p>
<h3>If You Don't Meet The CKA And CAR Criteria</h3>
<p>You can still proceed to transact in SIPs if you do not meet the Customer
Knowledge Assessment or Customer Account Review criteria. However, you
should be aware of the consequences of proceeding with the transaction,
and know that it is your responsibility to ensure that you understand any
capital markets products that you intend to invest in.</p>
<p>The financial institution will be required to put in place certain safeguards
if you intend to proceed despite the outcome of your Customer Knowledge
Assessment and Customer Account Review. For example, it might require that
you receive advice on whether the product is suitable for you, or explain
to you the general features and risks associated with investing in SIPs.</p>
<h4>Checklist</h4>
<p>Before you purchase an investment product or open an account to trade,
consider the following:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Is the financial institution regulated? Check if the financial institution
you are dealing with is regulated by MAS and if it is authorised to provide
financial advice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is the investment product suitable for you? Ask questions and understand
the product recommended to you, and why it is suitable for you. Consider
the following: How can the product help you achieve your investment objective?
How well do you understand the risks? If things go wrong, what is the maximum
you can lose? How much time do you need to monitor the productâ€™s performance?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are there any warning signs? Do not buy the product if you do not fully
understand the product or are not comfortable with the risks. Be careful
of verbal promises and guarantees of high returns. Remember that if something
sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Ask the financial institution
to refer you to the relevant clauses in the product documents that describe
the verbal representations made.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Remember, you can always walk away</h4>
<p>If you have any doubts, you have every right to decide not to purchase
a product.</p>
<p>Even though financial institutions need to have a reasonable basis when
recommending an investment product to you, you too need to consider the
advice and recommendation carefully. Do not be induced by gifts or discounts,
or be pressured to make a purchase decision.</p>
<p>Say "No" if you do not fully understand the product or disagree with the
advice provided. Walk away if you have doubts about the product or your
dealings with a financial institution or individuals representing the financial
institution.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you decide not to take up the offer of financial
advice or choose to invest in a product that the financial institution
did not recommend to you, you will have to take responsibility for ensuring
that product is suitable for you.</p>
