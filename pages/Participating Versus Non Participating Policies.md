<h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Participating (par) policies allow you to share in the profit of the participating
fund and this comes in the form of bonuses or cash dividends</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bonuses and cash dividends are non-guaranteed benefits until they have
been declared</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>What Is A Par Policy?</h3>
<p>Par policies are insurance policies that participate or share in the profits
of the insurance company's par fund. Apart from guaranteed benefits, they
also provide non-guaranteed benefits.</p>
<p>The sum assured is guaranteed. It is paid when the policy matures, when
you pass on or when you become totally and permanently disabled (if this
benefit is provided) during the policy period.</p>
<p>The non-guaranteed benefits may include bonuses and cash dividends. They
depend on how the par fund's investments are performing, how many claims
are made on the fund and the expenses incurred by the par fund.</p>
<h3>What Is A Non-Par Policy?</h3>
<p>Non-par policies are not entitled to any profits that the insurance company
makes.</p>
<p>The sum assured is guaranteed. Depending on the policy contract, it is
paid when the policy matures or when you pass on. You are typically not
entitled to any non-guaranteed benefits.</p>
<h3>How Do Par Policies Work?</h3>
<p>When buying a par policy, your premiums will be pooled together and invested
with premiums from other policyholders in the fund.</p>
<p>The par fund invests in a range of assets to generate an investment return.
The fund's assets can include government and corporate bonds, equities,
properties and cash. The proportion invested in each asset class may change
over time, as determined by the insurer.</p>
<p><strong>Tip: </strong>You can find par fund's investment strategy, including
its broad investment mix, in the product summary.</p>
<h3>Risks Of Par Policies</h3>
<p>As a policyholder, you will share in the risks of the par fund including:</p>

<p>These risks can affect the performance of the par fund, which in turn
affects the bonuses or cash dividends to be declared and paid to you.</p>
<h3>Types Of Non-Guaranteed Bonuses</h3>
<p>Here are the common types of non-guaranteed bonuses for par policies:</p>
<h4>Reversionary Bonuses</h4>
<p>These are declared regularly, e.g., annually. Once declared, they will
form part of the guaranteed benefits of your policy (that is, added to
the sum assured).</p>
<p>They are typically payable in full when a claim is paid or when the policy
matures. However, should you surrender the policy, only a proportion of
the accumulated reversionary bonuses will be payable.</p>
<h4>Cash Dividends</h4>
<p>Some par policies provide cash dividends as non-guaranteed benefits, but
these do not add to the sum assured. Although these dividends are typically
declared as immediate cash payments, some insurers may allow them to be:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Converted to additional sum assured (also known as paid-up additions)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Applied towards reduction of future premiums</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Re-invested with the insurer</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Terminal Bonuses</h4>
<p>These may be payable when you surrender the policy or make a claim, or
when the policy matures. They are separate from any reversionary bonuses.</p>
<h3>When A Bonus Is Declared</h3>
<p>Non-guaranteed bonuses are usually determined annually. Most often, they
take the form of an addition to the sum assured.</p>
<p>As a policyholder, you will be notified when the bonuses have been declared.
If there is a change in your bonus rates, the insurer will also provide
an updated projection of the revised total maturity benefit or total surrender
value.</p>
<p>When the fund performance has been unfavourable and the outlook remains
pessimistic, insurers may cut future non-guaranteed bonuses.</p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>The illustrated bonuses and cash dividends will
vary across policies. To find out more, read and compare the product summaries
of the policies that you are considering.</p>
<h3>How Bonuses Are Determined For Par Policies</h3>
<p>How much you get in bonuses depends on factors such as:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Performance: The par fund’s investment performance and future outlook</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Expenses: Amounts paid as claims and the expenses incurred by the par
fund – expenses include investment, management, distribution, tax and other
expenses</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Smoothing policy: Insurers generally try to avoid large fluctuations in
the non-guaranteed bonuses from year to year by smoothing bonuses over
time. For example, insurers may hold back some bonuses in the years when
the fund has performed well. This is so that bonuses can be maintained
when the fund performs poorly. As a result, the amount of non-guaranteed
bonuses may not necessarily follow the short-term ups and downs in the
investment markets.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When determining bonuses, the insurer must ensure that:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>All its par policyholders are treated equally and fairly</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The par fund has enough funds to support the bonuses that are declared
(that is, become guaranteed) without compromising the solvency of the par
fund or the company</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The insurer's board of directors must approve all bonuses after taking
into account the appointed actuary's recommendation. Once approved, the
non-guaranteed reversionary bonuses for that year will be declared (that
is, become guaranteed).</p>
<p><strong>Tip: </strong>Once a reversionary bonus is declared, the insurer
cannot subsequently reduce it or take it away upon a claim.</p>
<h4>What About Terminal Bonuses?</h4>
<p>Unlike reversionary bonuses, any terminal bonuses are only calculated
upon maturity, claim and/or surrender. As such, if the par fund is performing
poorly at that point in time, you could receive a low or zero terminal
bonus.</p>
<h3>Safeguards For Par Policyholders</h3>
<p>To protect par policyholders, insurers are required to have a few safeguards
in place.</p>
<p><strong>Limits on profits distributed to shareholders </strong>– Profits
paid to shareholders of the insurance company are limited to 1/9th of the
value of bonuses given to par policyholders. This means that for every
$9 distributed to par policyholders, only up to $1 can be distributed to
shareholders.</p>
<p><strong>Shortfalls in assets will be met </strong>– If there is any shortfall
in the assets needed to achieve your guaranteed benefits, it must be met
by the shareholders. This means that the insurer must pay the guaranteed
benefits even if the par fund performs poorly.</p>
<p><strong>Process must be overseen by the board</strong> – Insurers selling
par policies must have an internal policy that sets out how it will manage
the par fund (including how bonuses are determined and allocated). The
board must approve and regularly review the policy and ensure the insurer
adheres to this policy.</p>
<p><strong>Tracking the performance of a par policy</strong>
</p>
<p>After buying a par policy, you'll receive an Annual Bonus Update. This
will include information on the:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Performance of the par fund and its future outlook</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bonuses declared (if any) to your policy for that year</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Whenever there is a change in the bonuses declared, you'll also receive
an update of the:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Projected total maturity value for an endowment policy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Revised total surrender value for a whole life policy or an endowment
policy</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You may also request an updated policy illustration of future non-guaranteed
benefits, based on the insurer’s best estimate of the performance of the
par fund.</p>
<h3>When You Surrender A Policy</h3>
<p>Buying a life insurance policy is a long-term commitment. Early termination
usually involves high costs. The surrender value that is payable to you
may be zero or less than the total premiums paid.</p>
<p>There may be no cash value in the first three years after policy inception
as most of the premiums have been used to off-set the total distribution
costs of such products (e.g. commissions and benefits paid to your financial
adviser).</p>
<h4>For Par Policies</h4>
<p>Par policies usually build up cash values after a minimum period. The
cash value (surrender value) is the amount you will be paid if you cash
in (surrender) your policy. It includes a portion of the bonuses and cash
dividends that have been declared.</p>
<p>Depending on the performance of the par fund when you surrender your policy,
the cash value that you will receive may be less than what was previously
illustrated to you.</p>
<p>Do note that the amount paid to you will be adjusted to deduct specific
charges and any amounts owed to the insurer.</p>
<h4>For Non-Par Policies</h4>
<p>Depending on your product's features, non-par policies may not have any
cash value (surrender value) if you surrender your policy.</p>
<p>If it does, it is important to know how much you would receive if you
decide to cash in your policy as this may be less than your total premiums
paid to-date.</p>
<p>If it does not, you may only receive a refund for any unused premium should
you surrender your policy.</p>
