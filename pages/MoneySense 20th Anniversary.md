MoneySense Turns 20 This Year

MoneySense was started in 2003 to help Singaporeans manage their money well and make sound financial decisions on their own. We have been supporting Singaporeans in uplifting their financial literacy and planning for their future by providing practical, unbiased and relevant programmes and resources.

Take a walk down memory lane with us, as we look back on MoneySense's key initiatives in our last 20 years!

**Logo**

As&nbsp;we turn 20, we specially designed an anniversary logo featuring a circular arc that symbolises a new dawn. The use of&nbsp;MoneySense’s&nbsp;corporate&nbsp;colours, blue and orange,&nbsp;represents&nbsp;our concerted and enduring efforts to enhance Singaporeans’ financial literacy and well-being even as we embark on MoneySense's next bound.

**MoneySense's Next Bound**

In pursuing our mission to make money matters simple for Singaporeans, MoneySense Council has expanded its membership beyond government, to include members from the industry, academia, and the media.&nbsp;

We have come far in our financial education journey. But we recognise that there is still much to do. We are redoubling efforts to involve more stakeholders from the private and people sectors, as well as to provide more useful information, tools and services to Singaporeans.

We look forward to your continued support!
