<li>
<p>An ILP's fees and charges include insurance coverage and policy administration
charges as well as fund management fees</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not all of your premium paid may be used to buy units. The proportion
used is commonly known as the premium allocation rate</p>

<h3><strong>Fees and charges</strong></h3>
<p>You can find the details of all the charges of an investment-linked insurance
policy (ILP) in its Product Highlight Sheet (PHS), Product (Fund) Summary
and Policy Contract.</p>
<p>The different types of fees and charges are as follows:</p>

<p>A portion of the premiums you pay may be deducted upfront before the remainder
is invested in units of a sub-fund (i.e., a PA rate of 20%, means only
$200 of a premium of $1,000 will be used to purchase units)</p>

<p>Typically, PA rates will increase year on year until it reaches 100% or
more (i.e., an insurer may give bonus units on every premium amount paid)</p>

<p>Note that fees and charges may not be guaranteed and are subject to change.
These fees and charges (including distribution costs such as commissions)
are typically deducted from the (monthly) sale of units.</p>
<h3><strong>How much of the premium is used to purchase units?</strong></h3>
<p>The full amount of premium paid may not be used to buy units. The proportion
used is commonly known as the premium allocation rate and is stated in
the Product Summary or Policy Contract.</p>
<p>For most single premium policies and top-ups, 100% of your premium is
used to purchase units. For regular premium policies, the amount of premium
used will depend on whether it has a "front-end" or "back-end" loading.</p>
<p>In a front-end loaded policy, most of the premiums will pay for the insurer's
expense including distribution and administration costs in the early years.
The remainder pays for units. Over time, the amount of premium used to
buy units increases until it reaches 100%.</p>
<p>Under a back-end loaded policy, 100% of premiums are used to buy units
from the start. Distribution and administration costs are covered by back-end
charges imposed when you surrender your policy, partially or fully, within
a certain period of time.</p>
<p>Although the premium allocation structure differs for front-end and back-end
loaded ILPs, the overall effect of the charges will be similar.</p>
<h3><strong>How unit prices are computed</strong></h3>
<p>How it is computed and the frequency of computation may vary from sub-fund
to sub-fund. Find out more in the Product Summary and Policy Contract.
<br>
<br>Generally, the fund manager calculates the sub-fund’s <strong>net asset value </strong>based
on a valuation of its underlying assets, after the market closes. After
deducting fund management charges from the net asset value, the balance
is then divided by the total number of units to derive the unit price.</p>
<p>All ILP orders to purchase or sell units are settled based on the next
computed unit price (next business day’s price), sometimes referred to
as forward price.</p>
