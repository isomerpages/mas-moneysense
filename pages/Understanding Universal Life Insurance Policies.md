<p><strong>Key takeaways</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Universal life insurance policies are traditionally marketed as a tool
for leaving a substantial inheritance to your loved ones. You should prioritise
your basic protection needs ahead of leaving behind an inheritance</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You should assess if you can afford to pay a very high one-time premium
upfront (e.g., US$200,000 in exchange for a large sum assured of US$500,000)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You may be offered a loan to pay the premium. Think very carefully before
taking it up as you face a higher risk of losing your life insurance coverage
prematurely if you cannot repay the loan</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You may need to pay additional premiums after the upfront payment to prevent
your policy from lapsing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are also other types of universal life insurance policies which
focus on wealth accumulation, thus offering lower protection benefits with
a lower premium outlay</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>How do universal life insurance policies work?</strong></h3>
<p>Universal life insurance policies are bundled products, meaning you get
insurance protection and an investment return.</p>
<p>Investment returns are based on the rates declared periodically by your
insurer (known as “crediting rate”) and can be changed at the insurer’s
discretion. However, the insurer cannot decrease it beyond the minimum
crediting rate which can be set at 0%.</p>
<p>Universal life insurance policies are different from typical whole life
insurance policies. Unlike most life insurance policies, after the inception
of universal life insurance policies, you have the option of adjusting
the sum assured and the cash value of your policy.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>Sum assured is what your insurer pays your beneficiaries
when you die. Your insurer can choose whether to cover you for a higher
sum assured based on additional risk assessment.</p>
<p>Cash value, also known as surrender value, is what you will get back if
you cancel your policy. You may pay more premiums at any time to increase
the cash value of the policy.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><strong>What are the key features?</strong></h3>
<p>Universal life policies are typically marketed as a tool for leaving a
substantial inheritance to your loved ones after your death. In return,
your insurer collects a large upfront lump-sum premium that can run into
seven figures. These are known as protection-oriented universal life policies.</p>
<p>You should only consider buying a universal life policy if you have the
means to pay the premium without borrowing. This is to avoid losing insurance
coverage.</p>
<p>Your financial adviser may ask if you would like to take a loan from a
financial institution to pay for the large sum of premiums – known as premium
financing. <strong>Think twice before taking this up.</strong>
</p>
<p>There are also other types of universal life insurance policies, which
focus on wealth accumulation thus offering lower protection benefits with
lower premium outlay. These are known as savings-oriented universal life
policies.</p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>Do you have the means to repay your premium financing
loan consistently (both principal and interest), including when interest
rates rise?</p>
<p>If you take up premium financing but fail to make your loan repayments,
you may lose your insurance coverage as the financial institution who lent
the money (“lending FI”) can surrender your policy to the insurance company
to get back what you owe them.</p>
<p>Another scenario to be mindful of is that your lending FI may ask you
to fork out a lump sum to pay off the loan in full or partially. This could
happen if the lending FI deems you or your insurer to be less credit-worthy.
This could also happen when the investment returns of your policy decline
such that the cash value of your policy becomes lower than your loan amount.
Can you find the money at short notice?</p>
<p>The bottomline: If you lose your insurance coverage as a result, how big
of an impact will it be for you or your loved ones?</p>
<p>Consider these points very carefully before you take up premium financing.</p>
<h3><strong>What you should be aware of before buying</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>Fees</strong></h4>
<p>You will have to pay fees at various points after buying a universal life
insurance policy.</p>
<p>These include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Premium charge </strong>– Your insurer may deduct a percentage
from your premium payment for its expenses, such as distribution and administration
costs for offering the product</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Insurance charge</strong> – Some insurers charge a recurring fee
for insurance coverage, and the amount usually increases with your age</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Administration charge</strong> – You may have to pay administrative
costs to your insurer</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Partial withdrawal charge </strong>– Your insurer may charge a
fee if you withdraw part of the amount you have accumulated in the cash
value of your policy. The sum assured of your policy may also be reduced
as a result</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Surrender charge </strong>– If you withdraw everything in the
cash value of your policy, you are effectively terminating the policy and
insurance coverage ends. Your insurer may also charge a fee for that</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tip: </strong>Insurance and administration charges are typically
deducted from your policy’s cash value on a monthly or annual basis.</p>
<p>Check your policy contract for the frequency and amount of deduction.</p>
<p><strong>Tip: </strong>Your insurer can revise the charges but will need
to notify you. Check with your insurer on the notice period that will be
given.</p>
<p>For details on how various charges affect the cash value of your policy,
refer to the policy illustration provided to you when you purchase the
policy.</p>
<h3><strong>Possible lapse</strong></h3>
<p>There is the possibility that the cash value of your policy gets lower
and lower. For instance, the investment returns turn out to be much lower
than expected while fees add up.</p>
<p>When the cash value gets to zero, your policy lapses, unless you pay additional
premiums.</p>
<p>You should refer to your policy illustration for possible lapse scenarios
and review the cash value of your policy regularly. Insurers will typically
make available periodic statements updating you of the cash value of your
policy and notify you when your policy is about to lapse.</p>
<h3><strong>Policy Term</strong></h3>
<p>Some universal life policies can be terminated by the insurer, after a
notice period. In such a case, you will get back the accumulated cash value
in your policy.</p>
<p>There are two main types of universal life insurance policies.</p>
