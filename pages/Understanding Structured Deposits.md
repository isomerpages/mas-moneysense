<p>The return on a structured deposit is usually dependent on the performance
of an underlying financial instrument</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The full principal amount of the investment will be returned to you if
you hold your investment to maturity, and the bank remains solvent</p>

<h3><strong>What are structured deposits?</strong></h3>
<p>A structured deposit combines a deposit with an investment product. The
return on a structured deposit depends on the performance of an underlying
financial asset, product or benchmark. These may include market indices,
shares, interest rates, bonds or other fixed-income securities, foreign
exchange rates, or a combination of these.</p>
<p>Structured deposits may be suitable for investors who want exposure to
assets or markets that are not easily accessible to retail investors.</p>
<h3><strong>Types of structured deposits</strong></h3>
<p>Here are some of the different structured deposits available:</p>

<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">

</li>
<li>
<p>Returns may be directly linked to the specified interest rate, i.e., if
the specified interest rate rises, your returns will rise and if the interest
rate falls, your returns fall. But some returns are inversely related,
i.e., when the specified interest rate falls, you get better returns and
if the interest rate rises, your return falls</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Payments may also rise or "step up" on fixed dates if deposit is not redeemed
by issuer</p>
</li>
</ul>

or defaults on its loans), there may be no returns for investor</p>

<p><strong>Note: </strong>Structured deposits may be offered in "tranches".
Each tranche has either a fixed offer period or is available until the
tranche is fully subscribed. The tranches may come with differing features
and returns.</p>
<h3><strong>What are the returns?</strong></h3>
<p>Your return is calculated according to a formula set out in the structured
deposit’s terms and conditions.</p>
<p>A structured deposit is different from a fixed deposit. Structured deposits
may provide the potential for higher returns compared to fixed deposits,
but you take on more risks, including the possibility that you receive
returns that are lower than expected.
<br>
<br>At maturity, you will receive the principal amount of the structured deposit.
But just like traditional deposits, the return of the principal and any
returns is subject to the credit risk of the bank holding the deposit.
If the deposit is withdrawn early, you may not get back 100% of the money
invested.</p>
<h3><strong>What are the risks?</strong></h3>
<p>Common risks associated with structured deposits include the following:</p>

<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>There may be substantial losses to your principal if you choose to end
the investment early</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You should also bear in mind that structured deposits may be subject to
periodic valuation, which may not be on a daily basis. This means that
you may not be able to withdraw your deposit immediately</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check the terms and conditions for early withdrawal of the deposit with
your bank</p>

<h4><strong>Fees and charges</strong></h4>
<p>Please check with your bank to find out about fees. If you make an early
withdrawal, you may have to forgo some of your returns as there could be
transaction or unwinding costs.</p>
<h3><strong>What's the most you can lose?</strong></h3>
<p>You may lose some or all of your return depending on how the return is
structured and whether the underlying financial asset, product or benchmark
underperforms.</p>
<p>The principal amount you invest is also subject to the credit risk of
the bank your structured deposit is held with. Further, if you withdraw
the deposit early, you may not receive 100% of the principal you invested.</p>
<h3><strong>Structured deposits versus fixed deposits</strong></h3>
<p>In the case of fixed deposits, the returns and maturity periods are fixed.
Structured deposits, on the other hand, have variable returns, and in some
cases, variable maturities as well.</p>

<h4><strong>Checklist</strong></h4>
<p>Not everyone should invest in structured deposits. Before you invest,
check that you:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Want potentially higher returns but are also <strong>prepared for variable returns</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Understand how returns are calculated</strong> and are clear about
the factors and scenarios that can affect returns</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Understand the risks associated with the structured deposit.</strong> Structured
deposits use derivatives to hedge risks and to improve performance. Investors
should be aware of the risks associated with the use of derivatives, including
the risk that the provider or counterparty of the derivative defaults.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Are prepared to leave your money tied up for the periods required.</strong> If
you need to convert your investments to cash in the short-term to meet
specific needs every now and then, a structured deposit may not be suitable
for you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Are comfortable with the credit risk of the bank</strong> offering
the structured deposit. If the bank defaults, you could lose all of your
investment.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Documents should you receive</strong></h3>
<p>There is no specific document to be provided by your financial advisory
representative. However, he is required to tell you information about:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The product’s features and risks, fees and charges, provisions for early
termination</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any warnings, exclusions or disclaimers which may apply</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The product provider</p>
