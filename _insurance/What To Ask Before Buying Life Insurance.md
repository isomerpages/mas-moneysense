<p>Never buy a product you don't understand</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
</ul>
<h3>What To Ask Before Buying Life Insurance</h3>
<p>Policy terms, features, and benefits can be overwhelming, especially for
someone new to buying insurance.</p>
<p>Your FA representative must explain the features of the policy he or she
recommended, and why it is suitable for you.</p>
<p>Use this checklist before you sign on the dotted line.</p>
<h3>Ask Yourself</h3>
<p>Before you buy, ask yourself the following questions:</p>
<h4>Has The FA Representative Recommended A Suitable Product?</h4>
<p>Does the product meet your:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Financial needs and objectives?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Budget and financial situation?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Investment risk level (if you are also building savings with this insurance
product)?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Does it supplement or complement the financial products (insurance and
investment products) you already have? Will you be over-insured or exposed
to more investment risks?</p>
<h4>Are Verbal Representations Provided In Line With What's In The Insurance Policy Documents?</h4>
<p>Verify these details of your insurance or investment documents:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Premium or investment amount</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Payment frequency</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Payment duration</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Early termination clauses</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Product risk</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maturity date</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Guaranteed or non-guaranteed returns</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Is The Information In The Insurance Policy Correct?</h4>
<p>Even if your FA representative asks you to, <strong>you should never:</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Provide false or misleading information</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fail to disclose information</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Over-state your income or ability to take risk</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Is There Any Benefit To Switching Insurance Or Investment Products?</h4>
<p>If your FA representative recommends that you cancel an existing product
and purchase another, check if it would cause you to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Suffer a penalty for terminating your existing product</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Incur transaction costs without gaining benefits</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Obtain less benefits at a higher or same cost than the original product</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Obtain some benefits at a higher cost</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If the answer is "yes" to any of these, ask him why he is recommending
the product to you. Do not buy the product if you are uncomfortable with
the recommendation.</p>
<h3>Ask Your FA Representative</h3>
<p>Ask your FA representative about the key features and terms of the product:</p>
<p><strong>About insurance protection:</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>What kind of insurance policy do you recommend and why?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What kind of benefits and limitations does it have?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Will it meet all my insurance protection needs?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What exclusions are there?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If I already have some life insurance coverage, how does the recommended
policy help me?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Will I be over-insured?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What if I want to change the amount of coverage as my needs change?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What kind of flexibility do I have?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How much will it cost now or in the future?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>About investments:</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>How will the recommended product meet my investment objectives?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are the returns like?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can I lose some or all of my money in this plan?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why is the product suitable for my risk profile?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What does it mean if some of my returns are guaranteed and some non-guaranteed?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are the risks for my non-guaranteed returns?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If I am buying an ILP, what funds are available? What are their investment
objectives, risks, performance track record, and their charges?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How did you select a fund based on my risk profile?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How does the recommended product fit in with my other investments? Will
it add more risk to the portfolio of products I now have?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What other investment products will suit me?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>About premiums:</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>How much premiums will I be paying?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How long do I need to pay the premiums for?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What happens if my financial needs or personal circumstances change, e.g.
I am retrenched or retire early?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What if I canâ€™t keep up with premium payments? What options do I have?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What happens to my insurance coverage if I stop paying my premiums?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>About withdrawals and termination:</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Can I make partial withdrawals of cash values?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What happens if I make an early withdrawal or terminate early?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What will it cost?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Take Your Time</h3>
<p>If you're uncomfortable with the recommendation or want to know what else
is available, ask your FA representative. You are not obligated to purchase
the product on the spot.</p>
<p>Take the time to think about it. Shop around to see what other insurers
are offering and then compare the different policies. Consult a trusted
family member or friend, if necessary.</p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>Read all documents carefully before signing. It
may be costly to terminate and replace a product in the early years.</p>
