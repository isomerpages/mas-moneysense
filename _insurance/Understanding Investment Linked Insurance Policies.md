<h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Investment-Linked Policies (ILPs) combine life insurance coverage and
investment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Investment returns are based on the sub-fund’s performance, so you need
to select one that meets your investment objectives and risk profile</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You bear the full investment risk, there are no guaranteed returns</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Insurance charges are paid for by the investment portion of the ILP. Such
charges rise with age and there is a risk that your units may not be enough
to pay for them</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Investment-linked insurance policies (ILPs) are policies that have life
insurance coverage and investment components.</p>
<p>Your premiums are used to pay for units in one or more sub-funds of your
choice. Some of the units purchased are then sold to pay for insurance
and other charges, while the rest remain invested.</p>
<p>ILPs provide insurance protection in the event of death or if included,
total and permanent disability (TPD). Depending on the policy, the death
or TPD benefit may comprise the higher of the sum assured or the value
of the units in the sub-fund at that point in time or some combination
of the two.</p>
<p>The value of these units depends on their price, which in turn depends
on the sub-fund’s performance. This is why ILPs usually do not have any
guaranteed cash values.</p>
<h3>Why Invest In ILPs?</h3>
<p>Some consumers value ILPs because of their flexibility.</p>
<p>You can change your investments by switching sub-funds when your financial
needs change. In addition, you may also top up your investments and make
partial withdrawals.</p>
<p>Most regular premium ILPs give you the flexibility to vary the insurance
coverage as your needs change. For example, you can reduce the coverage
(subject to a minimum sum assured) or even increase it (subject to underwriting).</p>
<p>But if you are only concerned about getting insurance coverage, <strong>an ILP may not be the most suitable product for you.</strong>
</p>
<h3>Types Of ILPs</h3>
<p>ILPs can be classified into two categories:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Single-premium ILPs –</strong> You pay a lump sum premium to buy
units in a sub-fund. Most single premium ILPs provide lower insurance protection
than regular premium ILPs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Regular premium ILPs</strong>  <strong>–</strong> You pay premiums
on an on-going basis. Regular premium ILPs may allow you to vary the level
of insurance coverage you need</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tip: </strong>Some ILPs may be categorised as Specified Investment
Products (SIPs). Do check with your financial institution whether the product
you are considering is an SIP.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>How The Investment Portion Works</h3>
<p>The investment strategy of an ILP is determined by your selection of the
sub-funds. This is unlike whole life or endowment policies where the insurer
determines the investment strategy.</p>
<p>Since an insurer will normally provide you with a range of sub-funds to
choose from, it is important that you understand the sub-fund’s investment
strategy and approach, as well as the potential risks.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Tip: </strong>If you don't need the insurance coverage, you may
consider unit trusts and exchange traded funds instead.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>What To Consider In Choosing A Sub-Fund</h4>
<p>Choose one of more sub-funds that suit your investment objectives and
time horizon.</p>
<p>The sub-fund’s historical performance should not be your only consideration.
Make sure that you are comfortable with the sub-fund’s risks and that these
are consistent with your risk profile:</p>
<p>Some sub-funds offer greater potential for higher returns but come with
an increased risk of financial losses. On the other hand, other sub-funds
(such as cash sub-funds), may be expected to yield more modest returns
in exchange for relatively lower risks.</p>
<p>For all ILP sub-funds under the CPF Investment Scheme, the CPF Board will
assign a risk classification. Do note that these risk classifications only
serve as a very broad guide on whether the sub-fund is suitable for you.</p>
<h4>Switching Sub-Funds</h4>
<p>ILPs allow you to move your money from one sub-fund to another. This is
known as fund switching.</p>
<p>It may be helpful for you to consider this if your financial circumstances
or risk appetite have changed and you no longer find your current sub-fund
suitable.</p>
<p>Most insurers offer a limited number of free switches and charge a nominal
fee per switch thereafter. Before switching from one sub-fund to another,
check whether you are entitled to free switches and if not, how much you
would need to pay for the switch.</p>
<h3>How The Insurance Portion Works</h3>
<p>While you are paying the same monthly premium throughout the life of the
policy, the cost of insurance typically increases year on year (as you
get older the risk of death, disability and illness increases). This is
even if you maintain the same coverage (i.e. sum assured).</p>
<p>This means that more units may be sold to pay for the insurance charges,
leaving fewer units to accumulate cash value under your policy.</p>
<p>If you have a combination of high insurance coverage and a poorly performing
sub-fund, the value of your units may not be enough to pay the insurance
charges. You will have to top up your premium or reduce the coverage.</p>
<p><strong>Tip: </strong>If protection is your main goal, other products
such as term insurance, may offer higher coverage at a lower cost.</p>
<h3>What Are The Risks?</h3>
<p>Common risks associated with ILPs include the following:</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>For regular premium ILPs, insurers may also increase the cost of insurance
coverage, if there has been a sustained rise in claims. If so, any increase
would be applied to an entire class of policies and not just to an individual
policy</p>

<h3>What's The Most You Can Lose?</h3>
<p>ILPs usually do not have any guaranteed cash values. Hence, you can potentially
lose the entire value of your investment.</p>
<h3>Before You Invest: Things To Note</h3>
<p>Consider if an ILP is suitable for you:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>ILPs are better suited for those with a longer investment horizon</strong> to
ride out market fluctuations and defray initial costs which can significantly
limit short-term potential returns.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The insurance coverage between ILPs differ.</strong> Some are more
investment-oriented with very little insurance coverage, whilst others
will allow you to set the level of coverage that you require. Do note that
the more you are covered for, the more units will be needed to pay for
the coverage and that leaves less units to be invested.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Do consider whether you can keep up with the premiums</strong> if
you no longer earn an income.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Do compare investing through an ILP against investing in other investment products.</strong> In
some cases, the sub-fund that you are interested in may also be offered
as a unit trust (i.e. without insurance coverage).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>After You Invest: Review Your Statements</h3>
<p>Read your ILP statements, which your insurer will send to you at least
once a year (or more frequently). This statement shows the value of units
in the policy, transactions for the period and charges paid through the
sale of units.</p>
<p>Do review this statement to check if the ILP and sub-funds selected continue
to suit your needs. Seek advice if your circumstances and what you need
have changed.</p>
<h3>Using CPF For ILPs</h3>
<p>You can use your CPF savings to buy an ILP if the ILP is included under
the CPF Investment Scheme. The CPF Board assigns a risk classification
which serves as a broad guide to all ILP sub-funds under CPFIS.</p>
