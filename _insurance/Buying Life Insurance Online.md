<h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>No financial advice is given if you decide to buy life insurance online</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You may not get back the premiums paid if you terminate or surrender your
policy early</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You must make sure the product you choose suits your risk profile and
needs</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Buying life insurance usually involves talking to a <a href="https://www.moneysense.gov.sg/financial-advice-who-you-could-be-dealing-with/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">financial advisory (FA) representative</a>.
Before recommending you a suitable life insurance product, your FA representative
will undertake a <a href="https://www.moneysense.gov.sg/financial-advisory-process/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">financial needs analysis</a> with
you to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Understand your insurance objectives</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Risk appetite for investment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Financial needs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Personal circumstances</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It is possible for you to buy life insurance online in just a few minutes
with no advice provided â€” known as <a href="https://www.moneysense.gov.sg/buying-direct-purchase-insurance/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Direct Purchase Insurance (DPI)</a>.
This means you have to assess and select for yourself a suitable product
to buy as you will not be receiving advice and a recommendation from a
financial adviser.</p>
<p>DPI are priced without distribution expenses. Hence, you pay lower premiums
than on comparable life insurance products.</p>
<h3>Choose The Right Policy</h3>
<p>The online platform you use to purchase the policy directly will provide
the product's information through documents such as&nbsp;the Product Summary,
Policy Illustration, Product Highlights Sheet, Cover Page, and Bundled
Product Disclosure. Read these documents carefully to make sure that the
policy you buy meets your needs.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Check out online portal <a href="http://www.comparefirst.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">compareFirst</a> for information on all
the life insurance products available to retail consumers, including direct
purchase insurance, which are priced without distribution expenses. Use
this platform to compare the features and premiums of the different products
you are considering.</p>
<p>Once you have decided on a product, you will also have to answer a series
of questions. These include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Age</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gender</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Health/medical conditions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How much insurance you need, and for how long (if you are purchasing term
insurance)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>Buying life insurance is a long-term commitment.
Take the time to consider the questions and answer them carefully. Avoid
making a decision in haste. Not answering questions on your health and
medical conditions truthfully, for example, could lead to your policy being
voided when you need it.</p>
<h3>Know What You're Buying</h3>
<p>Before completing the purchase, you will need to acknowledge that you
have:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Read and understood the Policy Illustration and product summary, including
any exclusion of coverage</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Disclosed fully and truthfully all information requested in the application
form and any supplementary questionnaire(s)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If medical and moratorium or financial underwriting is required, you will
have to acknowledge that you have declared:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>All pre-existing medical conditions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All existing life policies that you own, or are in the process of applying
for</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your current financial situation (e.g. your income)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have minor pre-existing conditions, some insurers offer a moratorium
underwriting option to cover these conditions.</p>
<h3>Things To Note</h3>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>A life policy is not a savings account or deposit</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You may not get back the premiums paid (partially or in full) if you terminate
or surrender your policy early</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some benefits of a life policy&nbsp;may not be&nbsp;guaranteed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is a 14-day free-look period where&nbsp;you can cancel your policy,
and get your premiums refunded to you, less the medical and other expenses
which the insurance company has had to pay</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can request for an FA representative to tell you if the life policy
you're considering is suitable for you, and explain the product features</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you choose not to seek advice on the suitability of the policy, you
must decide for yourself if the life policy is suitable for your financial
circumstances and needs</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>Buying insurance online is not for everyone. If
you're uncomfortable at any stage of the online process, you may stop and
seek financial advice.</p>
