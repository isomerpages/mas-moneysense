<p>Health insurance helps you pay for your medical expenses when you fall
ill, get injured or become disabled.</p>
<p>All Singaporeans are covered under MediShield Life, a basic government
health plan to cover large medical expenses. Besides having to deal with
large medical or hospital bills, you may not be fit for work during your
recovery.</p>
<p>Some health insurance plans will provide you with cash payouts to help
pay for treatment or long-term care.</p>
<p>There are short-term and long-term policies. Long-term policies cannot
be terminated without your consent. For short-term policies, insurers may
terminate your policies by informing you in advance.</p>
<p>Be sure to buy a policy which fits your needs. Do note that a new policy
may not give you the same coverage as before.</p>
<h3>Types Of Health Insurance Plans</h3>

<h3>Who Should Buy Health Insurance?</h3>
<p>Singaporeans are already covered by MediShield Life, a compulsory health
insurance scheme that pays for basic public hospital treatments.</p>
<p>If you prefer to be admitted to a better type ward or private hospital,
you can consider an upgrade to an Integrated Shield Plan with wider coverage.</p>
<p>See&nbsp;<a href="https://www.moh.gov.sg/cost-financing/bill-estimator" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">how much hospital treatments cost</a>.</p>
<p>There are a few things to consider when choosing a health insurance plan:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>If you are young and healthy –</strong>&nbsp;Check to see if your
coverage is enough for you or if you wish to upgrade. Do not wait until
you develop health issues to get more cover as the insurer may exclude
coverage of that in your policy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>If you have a family –</strong>&nbsp;Make sure your family has
adequate health insurance. Medical emergencies can be costly. Check that
the deductibles and co-insurance payments are affordable for the long term.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>If you are a senior citizen –</strong>&nbsp;Check the&nbsp;CPF
Board website&nbsp;to see if you are covered under ElderShield. If you
are under 65 and opted out of ElderShield earlier, speak to any of the
private insurers to opt back in. Premiums and payouts are the same across
all insurers. You will need a medical assessment. Your application could
be rejected if you have a pre-existing illness.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>All Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents
born in 1980 or later are covered under CareShield Life (the enhanced ElderShield
Scheme) on 1 Oct 2020, or when they turn 30, whichever is later.</p>
<p>CareShield Life provides better basic protection against the costs of
long-term care should you become severely disabled. It offers higher payouts
that increase over time and you will receive the payouts for as long as
you remain severely disabled.</p>
<p>Those born before 1980 can choose to join CareShield Life if they are
not severely disabled. To make joining more convenient, Singapore Citizens
or Permanent Residents born between 1970 and 1979 (both inclusive) who
are insured under ElderShield 400 scheme and are not severely disabled
will be auto-enrolled onto CareShield Life from December 2021.</p>
<h3>If You Have Company Health Insurance</h3>
<p>Find out if you are covered under a group health insurance policy. If
so, what are you covered for? The policy may end when you change employer
or retire. So, you should have a personal health insurance policy as well.</p>
<p><strong>Do not wait until you stop working to buy a health insurance policy.</strong>&nbsp;By
then, you may not be insurable due to age or poor health.</p>
<h3>Choosing Your Level Of Coverage</h3>
<p>When choosing a policy that suits your healthcare needs, ask yourself
these three questions:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>What basic coverage do I already have?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What additional coverage am I looking for? Do I really need this?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are my options?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4>Basic Health Insurance Coverage</h4>
<p>As a Singaporean or Permanent Resident, you are already covered under
the basic Government health insurance plans:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>MediShield Life</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ElderShield (or CareShield Life from 2020) unless you choose to opt out</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>If You Want More Coverage</h4>
<p>If you have the budget for it, you may want more coverage such as for
a higher ward type or the ability to choose your own doctor.</p>
<p>If so, you could choose to upgrade your coverage by getting an Integrated
Shield Plan or ElderShield Supplements.</p>
<p>These plans add to your MediShield Life or ElderShield plans. There is
no duplication in coverage.</p>
<h4>How MediSave Fits In</h4>
<p>MediSave is a savings account for healthcare expenses, not a health insurance
policy. Part of your CPF contributions goes into your MediSave account
and this is part of your CPF savings.</p>
<p>You can use your MediSave to pay for you and your immediate family members:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Hospitalisation, day surgery and certain outpatient expenses</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Premiums for MediShield Life, Integrated Shield Plans, ElderShield and
CareShield Life</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;There are withdrawal limits on the use of
MediSave. Read more on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.moh.gov.sg/cost-financing/healthcare-schemes-subsidies/medisave" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Ministry of Health (MOH) website</a>.</p>
<h4>Assistance Under MediFund</h4>
<p>You can apply for assistance under the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.moh.gov.sg/cost-financing/healthcare-schemes-subsidies/medifund" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">MediFund scheme</a>&nbsp;if
you are a Singapore citizen receiving subsidised treatment and have difficulty
paying your medical bill at a MediFund-approved institution.</p>
<p>To apply, approach the medical social workers at the MediFund-approved
institutions where you have received treatment.</p>
