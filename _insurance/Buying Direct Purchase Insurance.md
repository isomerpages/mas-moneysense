<p>Direct Purchase Insurance (DPI) are term and whole life insurance products
that you can buy directly from a life insurance company without paying
a financial advisory (FA) representative.</p>
<p>As DPI is sold without financial advice, no commission is charged, and
you pay lower premiums as a result. The broadly standardised features also
make it easier for you to compare products when deciding which DPI to purchase.</p>
<p>DPI products can be identified by the prefix "DIRECT" in their product
names.</p>

<h3>Who It Is For</h3>
<p>If you know which type of insurance will meet your needs, how much coverage
you need and you do not need any financial advice for your purchase, DPI
is for you.</p>
<p>However, if you are unsure about how much coverage you need or what insurance
to buy, you should consult an FA representative.</p>
<h4>Types of Direct Purchase Insurance (DPI)</h4>
<p>The two main types of DPI available are:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Term life with Total and Permanent Disability (TPD) cover and an optional
Critical Illness (CI) rider</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whole life with TPD cover and an optional CI rider</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Both types cover death and terminal illness.</p>
<p>Here are the key differences between the two types of DPIs:</p>

<h3>What DPI Covers</h3>
<p>The features of DPI are broadly standardised for easy comparison. However,
do read the small print as not all DPI products are the same across life
insurance companies.</p>
<h4>Protection Amount</h4>
<p>You can buy protection of up to $400,000, based on your needs:</p>
<p><strong>Sum Assured</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Term DPI: $50,000 - $400,000 per insurer</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whole Life DPI: $50,000 - $200,000 per insurer. The maximum sum assured
is aggregated for all Term DPI and Whole Life DPI at $400,000</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Entry Age</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Minimum age: 18 Years old</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maximum age: 45, 60 or 65 years old depending on the type of DPI purchased</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Amount of TPD Benefit</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>100% of sum assured</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Amount of Optional CI Rider Benefit</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>100% of sum assured (except for illnesses that require angioplasty and
other invasive treatments for coronary artery)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For illnesses that require angioplasty and other invasive treatments for
coronary artery, the payout will be 10% of the sum assured, subject to
a maximum amount of $25,000</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Coverage Period</h3>
<p>You can choose different coverage periods for a term life DPI. For whole
life, consider if you can afford to pay the premiums up to the age you
have chosen. Do not forget that you may not be earning any income after
retirement.</p>

<p>Most life insurance companies offer DPI. You may choose to buy directly
from their customer service centres or websites, if available.</p>
<h3>How To Buy DPI</h3>
<p>If you are considering DPI, make sure you understand your own insurance
needs. Determine if you can afford the insurance policy and how much coverage
you need.</p>
<p>Shortlist three to four products. Compare their features and benefits
on compareFIRST, an online portal that helps you compare products among
different insurers.</p>
<p>You can compare the different types of DPI as well as between DPI and
non-DPI, in terms of:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Premiums</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Features</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Benefits</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cash values</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Distribution cost</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you have picked the product that meets your needs, you can buy directly
from the customer service centres or websites (if available) of the life
insurance company.</p>
<p>Before purchasing any DPI, go through the DPI Fact Sheet and complete
the checklist that you will receive from the life insurance company. These
documents set out important information that you should consider when buying
DPI.</p>
