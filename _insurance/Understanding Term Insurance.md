<p>Term insurance is life insurance that provides insurance coverage only
for a fixed period of time. An example of term insurance is the Dependents'
Protection Scheme.</p>
<p>Buy term insurance if you only need protection coverage for a fixed period
of time. For example, if you want to be covered until your youngest child
completes university or is financially self-reliant.</p>
<h3>How It Works</h3>
<p>Here is a snapshot of the features and benefits:</p>

<p>Premium is constant throughout the period except when renewed, converted

renewal. It typically requires lower premiums than bundled products for

<p>Two types of term insurance: fixed or decreasing coverage. The sum assured
of decreasing term coverage products (e.g. those used to cover the default
of a housing loan) will reduce and become zero by the end of the term.
May be renewable or convertible. Often, premium when exercising renewal
is not guaranteed. There will be conditions attached before conversion
to another type of product (e.g. whole life, endowment or investment-linked)
is allowed.</p>

<li>
<p>* The premium for a term product may be higher than the bundled product
if it provides a higher death benefit, longer coverage term and premium
term.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Things To Note</h3>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Choose the coverage term carefully. You and/ or your dependents will not
be protected after the term expires.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you choose to reinstate the policy after it expires, you may be subject
to underwriting. Consider buying term insurance for a longer period of
protection when you are younger because the premiums can increase substantially
as you get older.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You may not be able to get term insurance past a certain age.</p>

</ul>
<h3>Common Types Of Term Insurance</h3>
<p>Here are two common examples of term insurance:</p>
<h4>Dependents' Protection Scheme</h4>
<p>Dependents' Protection Scheme (DPS) is an optional term insurance plan
that covers CPF members for a maximum sum of $70,000.</p>
<p>DPS provides CPF members and their families with some money to tide them
over the first few years after the death of the insured member or confirmation
of permanent disability. Coverage is worldwide.</p>
<p>Unless you opt out, the annual premium for DPS is automatically deducted
from your CPF account. The scheme is extended to CPF members when they
make their first contribution to CPF.</p>
<h4>Group Insurance Schemes</h4>
<p>A group insurance plan provides coverage to members of a group. Members
tend to be employees of a company or members of an organisation. They usually
receive insurance at a reduced cost because the insurerâ€™s risk is spread
across a group of policyholders.</p>
