<p>When it comes to choosing life insurance, you have many options. Before
asking which product is right for you, ask yourself why you want to be
insured. Knowing this will help you narrow down your search for a suitable
policy.</p>
<p>Do you want to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Provide for your loved ones when you are no longer around?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reduce financial loss due to illness or injury?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Protect, save and invest your money for retirement?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Leave behind some money for your loved ones as part of your estate?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Life insurance products fall under two broad categories: for protection
only, and for protection and investment.</p>
<h3>For Protection Only</h3>
<h4>Term Insurance</h4>
<p>Term insurance is the simplest protection product that is usually the
most affordable. It provides insurance coverage for a fixed period. An
example of term insurance is the Dependents' Protection Scheme.</p>
<p>Buy term insurance if you only need protection coverage for a fixed period
of time. For example, you want to be covered until your youngest child
completes university or is financially self-reliant.</p>
<h3>For Protection And Investment</h3>
<h4>Whole Life Policy (participating and non-participating)</h4>
<p>Whole life insurance policies provide life-long protection and also build
savings which are subject to investment risk.</p>
<h4>Endowment Policy</h4>
<p>Endowment policies are often marketed as a form of savings to help you
meet a specific financial goal, such as paying for your childrenâ€™s education,
or building up a pool of savings over a fixed term.</p>
<p>However, they are not like deposits. You may not get back what you put
in. A small part of your payments will pay for the insurance coverage while
the rest is invested and subject to investment risk.</p>
<h4>Investment-Linked Policy (ILP)</h4>
<p>ILPs have both a life insurance and an investment component. Premiums
are used to pay for units in the sub-funds of your choice. Some of the
units that you buy are then sold to pay for insurance coverage and for
other fees and charges, while the rest remain invested.</p>
<h4>Annuity Policy</h4>
<p>An annuity provides a retirement income as it guarantees fixed payments
at monthly intervals, for as long as the policyholder lives, or for a fixed
period.</p>
<h4>Riders</h4>
<p>Riders may be offered to enhance the benefits of the original policy,
e.g. coverage for critical illnesses. Additional premiums have to be paid
for the riders and the premiums could increase with age.</p>
<h3>Term Versus Bundled Products</h3>
<p>Compare both types of products as each product fulfils a specific purpose.
Decide what features and benefits match your needs and buy the product
that best meets them.</p>
