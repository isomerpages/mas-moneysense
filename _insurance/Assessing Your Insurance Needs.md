<h3><strong>What are your insurance needs?</strong></h3>
<p>Nowadays, it is possible to be insured against all sorts of risks. But
it may not be necessary to cover yourself against all risks. Finding the
right insurance product is about knowing what you want to protect and how
much you will need to cover a financial loss if the event were to happen.</p>
<p>Here are the 3 main categories of insurance and how they can help you:</p>

<h3>How much insurance is enough?</h3>
<p>To help you decide what insurance you need, make a list of the risks or
events that concern you. Assess the likelihood of the event happening and
the financial loss you or your dependants may suffer if so.</p>
<p>Consider how you would cover the financial loss. Buying a watch to replace
a lost one might be fairly easy, but large hospital bills could set back
your retirement goals if you don't have savings or insurance to cover this.
If you already have some insurance policies, check to see if these cover
you for the risks you are concerned about.</p>
<p>Remember you do not need to have insurance for everything, just the things
that could set back your financial situation or your financial goals.</p>
