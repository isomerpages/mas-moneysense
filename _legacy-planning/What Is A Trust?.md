<h3>How Does A Trust Work?</h3>
<p>A trust is a legal arrangement between you (the settlor) and a trustee.</p>
<p>When you set up a trust, your appointed trustee takes ownership of your
assets and manages them in the best interest of your beneficiaries. You
can decide the terms of the trust including who your beneficiaries are,
and how much power you wish to retain over your trust.</p>
<p>As assets placed in a trust are not part of a deceasedâ€™s estate, <a href="https://www.judiciary.gov.sg/family/probate-and-administration" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">probate</a> is
not required, and disputes over the assets can be avoided.</p>
<h3>Types Of Trusts</h3>
<p><strong>Setting up a trust during your lifetime</strong>
</p>
<p>A living trust is set up during a settlor's lifetime, where the assets
are transferred to the trust. Examples are inter vivos, discretionary or
revocable trusts. It is done by executing a trust deed together with the
transfer of assets to the trustee.</p>
<p>The settlor can revoke or terminate the trust at any time.</p>
<p><strong>Testamentary trust</strong>
</p>
<p>A testamentary trust is made using a will and takes effect after the settlor's
death. This is useful where you have:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Young children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dependants with special needs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Beneficiaries who may inherit a large sum of money but are unable to manage
it</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Once this trust is in place, it is irrevocable.</p>
<h3>Tax matters</h3>
<p>The statutory income of a trustee is <a href="https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/other-taxes/working-out-estate-trust-income-tax-by-trustee-and-beneficiary/calculating-trust-income-tax" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">subject to income tax</a>.</p>
<p>If you're a beneficiary of a trust, you'll be:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Assessed on your share of entitlement of income at your personal income
tax rates</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Getting the same tax exemptions and concessions given to taxpayers who
are residents</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you're a non-resident beneficiary in Singapore, the trustee is required
to pay tax on your share of entitlement at the prevailing trustee rate
for that year of assessment.</p>
