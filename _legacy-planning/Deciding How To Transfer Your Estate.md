<h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Assets can be distributed during your lifetime, not only after death</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A will ensures the right person gets the right amount, at the right time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CPF nominations and right of survivorship take precedence over a will</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many ways to transfer your assets. You can transfer now or have
it done for you upon death. Consider the pros and cons before making your
decision.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Transfer before death, such as gifts and living trusts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transfer upon death:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Through the probate process</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Through other ways such as joint ownership and insurance nomination</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>Remember, your CPF savings are not included in
your estate. You should make a <a href="https://www.cpf.gov.sg/Members/Schemes/schemes/other-matters/cpf-nomination-scheme" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">CPF nomination</a> to
distribute your CPF savings to your beneficiaries.</p>
<h3>Transfer Before Death</h3>
<p>During your lifetime, your assets (e.g. your savings, property and investments)
can be transferred to anyone as gifts or through trusts.</p>
<div data-type="detailGroup" class="isomer-accordion isomer-accordion-white">
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary>Gifts</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Once the asset is unconditionally given away, you no longer hold the title
to it, and the receiver becomes and the new owner.</p>
</div>
</details>
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary>Trusts</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Trusts may be set up for distribution. They are usually used to control
and protect family assets, or when a beneficiary is too young or mentally
incapable of handling money matters.</p>
</div>
</details>
</div>
<p>A trust transfers your assets to a trustee, with specific instructions
on how you want the assets or income from the assets distributed.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Recurring fees and expenses over time make trusts
costly.</p>
<h3>Transfer Upon Death</h3>
<p>Whether you made a Will or not, your estate would be transferred through
the <strong>probate process.</strong> If you don't leave a Will, your estate
will be distributed to your beneficiaries according to the intestacy laws
or Will substitutes.</p>
<p>Intestacy laws are inflexible and the settlement process is long. Wills
and Will substitutes ensure that your estate is distributed more quickly,
and according to your wishes.</p>
<h4>Through Probate</h4>
<div data-type="detailGroup" class="isomer-accordion isomer-accordion-white">
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary>Writing a will</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>A written will lets the world know to whom you wish to leave your estate.
If your beneficiaries are under 21, you'll need two executors or trustees
to handle your estate on their behalf. You may also choose a guardian as
minor children may be unable to manage their affairs.</p>
</div>
</details>
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary>Testamentary Trusts</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>A testamentary trust can be made using a will. It takes effect after death
and is irrevocable once it has taken place. However, you can change the
contents of your will in your lifetime.</p>
</div>
</details>
</div>
<p></p>
<h4>Other Ways To Transfer Your Assets</h4>
<p>Joint ownership and insurance nominations are other ways to transfer your
assets quickly and inexpensively, outside the probate process.</p>
<div data-type="detailGroup" class="isomer-accordion isomer-accordion-white">
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary>Right of survivorship for joint ownership</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Under right of survivorship, jointly owned assets can be passed to the
surviving owner outside the probate process.</p>
<p>There are different types of joint ownership:</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>The bank may freeze the joint account until the surviving owner presents
the necessary documentation to the bank. Do check with your bank</p>
</li>
</ul>
</td>

<p>Joint-alternate accounts</p>
</td>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Each account holder can perform transactions on the account independently,
without needing the consent of the other account holders</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Generally, if one account holder passes away, the surviving account holder
can still operate the account independently. Do check with your bank on
the terms and conditions for closure of such accounts</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> A joint tenancy can be converted into a tenancy-in-common,
and vice versa. Fees and charges will apply. Think about which arrangement
works best for you.</p>

<details class="isomer-details">
<summary>Insurance nomination</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Under the Insurance Act, owners of life policies and accident and health
insurance policies with death benefits are allowed to distribute the policy
benefits to their nominees legally.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of nominations to consider:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>A trust nomination</strong> that takes precedence over a will</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>A revocable nomination</strong> that gives the insurance company
the right to pay out according to the last known document at the time of
the policy owner's death, be it a revocable nomination or the will</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Making a nomination is not compulsory. However, an insurance nomination
provides you with an affordable legal means of distributing the policy
benefits to your nominees.</p>
<p>If you didn't make an insurance nomination:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Your insurance company may pay up to $150,000 of the proceeds to anyone
who is a “proper claimant” under the Insurance Act</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any remaining amount above $150,000 will be paid to the executor</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you have made a will, the proceeds will be distributed according to
the will</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If there is no will, the proceeds will be distributed under the Intestate
Succession Act</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Let's Make A Plan</h3>
<p>Now that you've learned the various estate planning tools, it's time to
get your estate in order. You may want to seek <a href="https://pto.mlaw.gov.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">legal advice</a> to make sure your will
is valid. It can be altered at any time.</p>
<p>Your plan may be one or a combination of the following:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Will</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trust</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nominations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gifts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Right of Survivorship</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When you pass away, your executor will apply to the court for a Grant
of Probate. With a Grant of Probate, your assets will transfer to your
executor, who will then manage and distribute the assets according to your
will.</p>
<p>When there is a will, your executor will liaise directly with the institutions
involved in the transfer or distribution of the assets.</p>
