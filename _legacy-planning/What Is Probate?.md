<h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Even if there's a will, a grant of probate is still required</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The process of probate can take some time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You may need a lawyer to help with the paperwork</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.judiciary.gov.sg/family/probate-and-administration" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Probate</a> is
a legal process for distributing your estate according to the terms of
your Will. The executor named in the Will has to apply for a Grant of Probate
to legally distribute a deceased’s assets.</p>
<h3>How To Apply</h3>
<p>Depending on the value or complexity of the estate, a lawyer may or may
not be needed. A lawyer can help an executor:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Verify the original will at the Probate Counter, Registry of the Family
Justice Court</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Present court papers to extract the Grant of Probate. Documents include
originating summons, supporting affidavit and schedule of assets</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The whole process may take three to six months. You may receive the Grant
of Probate within a month of filing the last court document.</p>
<p>As for which Court to apply to, generally, estates with assets of less
than $5 million fall under the jurisdiction of the Family Courts. Estates
of a higher value fall under the Family Division of the High Court.</p>
<h4>Documents Needed</h4>
<p>You will need the following documents:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Original death certificate of the deceased</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Original will of the deceased</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The deceased’s marriage certificate (if any)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Original death certificates of next-of-kin who have passed on</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Original death certificate of executor who may have passed on</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Children’s identity cards and birth certificates</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>What If There Is No Will?</h3>
<p>Without a will giving clear instructions on how to distribute an estate,
the probate process gets more complicated. It will be longer and more expensive.</p>
<p>Here's a look at the probate process with and without a will:</p>

<p>Your family has to decide on an administrator for your estate, or have
one appointed by the Court.
<br>The administrator is usually the spouse or one of the next-of-kin of the
deceased, i.e. a beneficiary under the Intestate law (for non-Muslims)
or by Muslim law (for Muslims).</p>

<p>The executor you appointed applies to the Court for a <a href="https://www.judiciary.gov.sg/family/how-to-file-grant-of-probate" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Grant of Probate</a> with

</table>
<p>Once the Court has issued the Grant, the administrator or executor may
bring it to the banks or to HDB to get access to your assets.</p>
<h3>For Muslim Estates</h3>
<p>An applicant for Letters of Administration involving a Muslim estate has
to <a href="https://www.muis.gov.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">apply online</a> for
an Inheritance Certificate from the Syariah Court specifying the beneficiaries
of the estate and their respective shares of the estate.</p>
<h3>Alternatives to the Grant of Probate</h3>
<p>If your estate is less than $50,000, your family can apply to the <a href="https://pto.mlaw.gov.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Public Trustee's Office</a> for
help in administering it, instead of going to Court. They don't have to
apply for a grant of probate, provided they meet all the requirements.</p>
