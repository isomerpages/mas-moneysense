<h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>You can receive a retirement income from CPF LIFE, by investing through
the SRS, from your investments and by monetising your property</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You could also take on part-time jobs to supplement your retirement income</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Besides your cash savings and CPF LIFE payouts, it is possible to have
other sources of income after you retire. These can be your Supplementary
Retirement Scheme (SRS) funds, insurance payouts, downsizing or renting
out your property, investment returns, or any part-time employment.</p>
<h3>Where Will Your Income Come From?</h3>
<p>An important part of retirement planning is to assess your available resources

<h3>Don’t Forget About Your Insurance</h3>
<p>Is your insurance coverage adequate? Healthcare costs rise as we get older.
All of us are covered under <a href="https://www.moh.gov.sg/cost-financing/healthcare-schemes-subsidies/medishield-life" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">MediShield Life</a>,
but you could consider <a href="https://team.dms.mas.gov.sg/sites/csi/consEdn/Comms/Website/Past%20Websites/2023/Offline%20Website/MON-241-PRD/www.moneysense.gov.sg/starter-packs/guide-to-types-of-health-insurance.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">additional cover</a> to
meet other healthcare needs and preferences. Do weigh up the impact of
the additional costs on your retirement savings, too.</p>
<p>Do ensure that you're still covered during your retirement years. Some
policies offer an option to stop paying premiums upon retirement, while
still enjoying coverage.</p>
<h3>Ways To Save For Retirement</h3>
<p>Here are a few ways to build up your retirement nest egg:</p>
<h4>CPF Savings</h4>
<p>From the moment you make your first CPF contribution to your Ordinary,
Special, and Medisave Accounts (OA, SA, and MA), you're already leveraging
on the risk-free and attractive interest rates.</p>
<p>When you turn 55, a Retirement Account (RA) is created for you where your
savings can earn up to 5% interest* per annum. On top of this, you will
also be eligible to earn an additional 1% interest on the first $30,000
of your combined balance, with up to $20,000 from your OA.</p>
<p><em>*Including an extra 1% interest paid on the first $60,000 of a member’s combined CPF balances, with up to $20,000 from the OA.</em>
</p>
<h4>Supplementary Retirement Scheme</h4>
<p>The <a href="https://www.mof.gov.sg/schemes/individuals/supplementary-retirement-scheme" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Supplementary Retirement Scheme (SRS)</a>,
operated by the private sector, complements the CPF to enhance your retirement
savings.</p>
<p>Participation in the scheme is voluntary – your contributions can be used
to purchase various investment instruments. You benefit from attractive
tax reliefs:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Every dollar contributed reduces your taxable income by a dollar</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Investment gains can accumulate tax-free</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tax is only payable when you withdraw your savings from SRS, and on only
50% of the amount if you withdraw at retirement</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Monetising Your Property</h4>
<p>If you own your HDB flat and have met the Minimum Occupation Period, you
could rent out a room or the whole flat to collect a regular rental income.</p>
<p>You can also consider the following:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>HDB’s <a href="https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/living-in-an-hdb-flat/for-our-seniors/monetising-your-flat-for-retirement/lease-buyback-scheme" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Lease Buyback Scheme (LBS)</a>,
which allows you to sell part of your flat’s lease back to it. The proceeds
will be used to top up your CPF Retirement Account, from which you will
get a steady income from CPF LIFE. You can continue living in your flat
throughout your retirement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Right-sizing your flat to supplement your retirement income. As your adult
children establish their own homes, you may consider selling your existing
flat and buying a smaller flat from either the resale market or from the
HDB.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <a href="https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/living-in-an-hdb-flat/for-our-seniors/monetising-your-flat-for-retirement/silver-housing-bonus" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Silver Housing Bonus (SHB)</a>,
which offers a cash bonus when you use some of your sale proceeds from
right-sizing to top up your CPF Retirement Account and join CPF LIFE.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Investments</h4>
<p>Investing can help you to grow your retirement nest egg, but it is not
without risk. You may need to rebalance your portfolio to more conservative
investments as you near retirement, in order to protect your savings.</p>
<p><strong>Before retirement</strong>
</p>
<p>If you are early in or midway through your career and have the risk appetite
to do so, you can consider investing in long-term and medium to higher
risk products, which offer higher returns, in order to boost your savings.</p>
<p>If you are at the pre-retirement stage of life though, your investment
horizon is shorter. That is when you will want to guard your savings so
that you will have enough for your golden years.</p>
<p>This means you should:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Lower your risk profile, and avoid products which might cause you to lose
your capital</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Buy products which can be easily liquidated for cash</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consider products which generate a regular income at regular intervals</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>When you retire</strong>
</p>
<p>One strategy to maintain an income flow throughout your retirement is
to stagger your access to funds. “Bucket”, or allocate, your investments
according to the <strong>short-, medium- and long-term.</strong>
</p>
<p>You could adopt different investment goals for each period. For example:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>For your short-term “Bucket 1”, you can consider conservative or more
liquid products to cover your immediate living expenses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Subsequent buckets could aim for higher growth to hedge against possible
inflation risks.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This approach may not suit everyone, so do take time to carefully consider
whether it suits you in terms of your personal circumstances, risk appetite
and also how well you understand the various financial products. You should
assess whether a product is conservative, liquid or allows for some growth,
and is suitable for the objectives you have in mind.</p>
<h4>Employment</h4>
<p>You may have retired, but if you're still healthy and able, why not stay
engaged in the workforce, if the opportunity is there? You could consider
part-time or temporary positions, or turn a hobby into gainful employment.</p>
