<p><strong>Note: </strong>The Intestate Succession Act does not apply to
Muslims. The estate of a Muslim is governed by Muslim law.</p>
<h3>Consequences Of Intestacy</h3>
<p>Should you pass away intestate, a number of issues may arise.</p>
<p><strong>Uncertainty over guardians</strong>
</p>
<p>If both parents pass away at the same time, guardianship over their children
is uncertain. Disagreements may arise as to who is the most suitable person
to be the guardian. An ex-spouse may be able to gain access to the assets
as the other parent of the children.</p>
<p><strong>Delay in settlement</strong>
</p>
<p>Without a will, the probate process gets more complicated. Distribution
of assets may take longer resulting in higher legal costs.</p>
<p><strong>Unintended consequences</strong>
</p>
<p>Distribution of assets may not reflect what the deceased intended. Elderly
parents will be excluded if the deceased leaves behind a spouse and children.
When appointing administrators, the law gives priority to the next-of-kin
of the deceased person’s family. This may not be in accordance with your
wishes.</p>
<h3>Muslim Estates</h3>
<p>For Muslim estates, the beneficiaries must apply to the Syariah Court
for an Inheritance Certificate to establish the share of each beneficiary.
A Grant of Probate or Letters of Administration may need to be obtained
after the Inheritance Certificate has been issued.</p>
<p>Muslims can dispose or give away their estates through a <em>hibah</em> or <em>nuzriah</em>.
However, through a will, Muslims can only give away a third of their estate
to persons who are not already entitled under the Inheritance Certificate.</p>
