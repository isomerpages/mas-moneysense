<p>Many of us actively plan ahead for the future by saving up, investing
and buying insurance.</p>
<p>We do this because we want to be sure that we are prepared for a rainy
day. We also want to be sure that we do not inconvenience our family members
too much when they care for us in the future.</p>
<p>However, how many of us actually plan for the possibility that we may
lose our mental capacity?</p>
<h3>What Is A Lasting Power Of Attorney (LPA)?</h3>
<p>An LPA is a legal document that lets you (the donor) appoint one or more
people you trust to be your donees. They will act and make decisions on
your behalf should you lose mental capacity one day.</p>
<p>You must be 21 or older and have mental capacity to make your LPA.</p>
<p>Your donees can be appointed to act in two broad areas:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Personal welfare; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Property and affairs.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>What If You Do Not Have An LPA?</h3>
<p>If you do not have an LPA and you lose mental capacity, your family member
is not automatically given the right to make legal decisions on your behalf.
This can hinder their ability to care for you.</p>
<p>As they have not been legally appointed to do so beforehand, they may
face difficulties trying to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Make care arrangements;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Manage your bank accounts and properties; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Decide how best to use your funds for your day-to-day needs.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Your family member will have to apply to Court to be appointed as your
deputy before they are authorised to make decisions and act on your behalf.</p>
<p>Compared to making an LPA, the deputyship application process will not
only take longer to complete but will also cost more.</p>
<h3>Which LPA Form Should You Use?</h3>
<p>There are two LPA forms, with LPA Form 1 being the most widely used:</p>
<h5>LPA Form 1</h5>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>A standard version that allows donors to grant general powers with basic
restrictions to donees</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>98% of Singapore Citizens who have made an LPA used this form</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h5>LPA Form 2</h5>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>For donors who wish to grant customised and specific powers to their donees</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Annex to Part 3 of this form has to be drafted by a lawyer</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Making An LPA Using Form 1</h3>
<p>To make an LPA using Form 1,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.msf.gov.sg/opg/AnalyticsReports/LPA_Form_1_2020.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">download the form</a>&nbsp;and
follow these steps:</p>
<p><strong>1. Choose one or more donees</strong>
</p>
<p>Choose your donees wisely. Choose what decision powers to grant to them.
If you have more than one donee, decide how they are to act.</p>
<p><strong>2. Get the LPA Certificate issued</strong>
</p>
<p>See an LPA Certificate Issuer. This critical safeguard ensures that you
do not make an LPA under pressure or duress. You can approach a professional
from one of these groups to issue an LPA certificate:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Accredited medical practitioner</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lawyer</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Psychiatrist</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The top 10 most visited accredited medical practitioners charge fees ranging
from $25 to $80. Most charge $50 for the service.</p>
<p><strong>3. Submit your LPA</strong>
</p>
<p>Submit your completed LPA application to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.msf.gov.sg/opg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Office of the Public Guardian online</a>.</p>
