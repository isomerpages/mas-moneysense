<div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/IMG_1064.jpeg"></div><p><strong>Your bank may offer a “Money Locking” feature, which stops scammers from digitally transferring your money out of your bank account. To access money that has been locked up, you need to visit a bank branch to verify your identity or do it through an ATM.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p></p><p>Practising cyber hygiene is vital to avoid getting scammed. To guard against scammers, consider “locking up” a portion of the money in your bank accounts.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The “locked-up” amount cannot be transferred out digitally by anyone, acting as a last line of defence against scammers who try to gain access to your accounts, such as through malware attacks. If you want access to the “locked-up” amount, you may need to visit a bank branch or ATM.</p><p>There may be processing time for unlocking these funds. You should therefore think carefully about how much you should lock. Take stock of your recurring expenses and near-term needs before making your decision.</p><h4>How it works&nbsp;</h4><p>Let’s say you have $5,000 in your bank account but only need $1,000 for your day-to-day or regular expenses. You may “lock up” $4,000, leaving $1,000 that you can use for services such as PayNow, transfers like GIRO payments, NETS transactions or ATM withdrawals.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Should scammers gain access to your account, the most they can access is the $1,000. They will not be able to spend or transfer out the $4,000 that has been “locked-up”.&nbsp;</p><h4>How to set it up&nbsp;</h4><p>The three local banks, DBS, OCBC, and UOB, offer this “Money Locking” feature.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Instructions for setting up:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>DBS: <a href="https://www.dbs.com.sg/personal/deposits/bank-with-ease/digivault" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Apply for a digiVault account</a> via the Digibank app and transfer the amount you’d like locked.
