<p><strong>Your bank may offer a “Money Locking” feature, which stops scammers from digitally transferring your money out of your bank account. To access money that has been locked up, you need to visit a bank branch to verify your identity or do it through an ATM.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Practising cyber hygiene is vital to avoid getting scammed. To guard against
scammers, consider “locking up” a portion of the money in your bank accounts.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The “locked-up” amount cannot be transferred out digitally by anyone,
acting as a last line of defence against scammers who try to gain access
to your accounts, such as through malware attacks. If you want access to
the “locked-up” amount, you may need to visit a bank branch or ATM.</p>
<p>There may be processing time for unlocking these funds. You should therefore
think carefully about how much you should lock. Take stock of your recurring
expenses and near-term needs before making your decision.</p>
<h4>How it works&nbsp;</h4>
<p>Let’s say you have $5,000 in your bank account but only need $1,000 for
your day-to-day or regular expenses. You may “lock up” $4,000, leaving
$1,000 that you can use for services such as PayNow, transfers like GIRO
payments, NETS transactions or ATM withdrawals.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Should scammers gain access to your account, the most they can access
is the $1,000. They will not be able to spend or transfer out the $4,000
that has been “locked-up”.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Safeguarding your CPF savings</h4>
<p>If you are a CPF member aged 55 or older and have no immediate plans to
withdraw your CPF savings, you are encouraged to safeguard your CPF savings
by activating the CPF Withdrawal Lock to disable online CPF withdrawals.
You can do so via the <a href="https://www.cpf.gov.sg/member/ds/account-settings" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">CPF account settings</a> after
logging on to the CPF website using your Singpass.</p>
<p>When you need to withdraw your CPF, you can enable online withdrawals
again via the CPF account settings. For your security, this will be subject
to Singpass Face Verification and a 12-hour cooling period. Members who
do not wish to enable online withdrawals again can withdraw in-person at
CPF Service Centres.</p>
<p>To safeguard members’ basic retirement adequacy, amounts up to the Basic
Retirement Sum are automatically reserved for retirement and cannot be
withdrawn. CPF Board has also introduced a default Daily Withdrawal Limit
of $2,000 for all members aged 55 or older, as part of <a href="https://www.cpf.gov.sg/member/faq/general-information---useful-tips/protection-against-scams/new-anti-scam-security-measures-available-to-cpf-members" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">a suite of anti-scam measures</a>.
Members can adjust this limit via the CPF account settings. All limit increases
are subject to Singpass Face Verification and a 12-hour cooling period.</p>
