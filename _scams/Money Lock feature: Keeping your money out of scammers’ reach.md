<p><strong><em>Your bank may offer a “Money Lock” feature, which stops scammers from digitally transferring your money out of your bank account. To access money that has been locked up, you need to visit a bank branch to verify your identity or use an ATM.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></strong></p><p></p><p>Practising cyber hygiene is vital to avoid getting scammed. To guard against scammers, consider “locking up” a portion of the money in your bank accounts.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The “locked-up” amount cannot be transferred out digitally by anyone, acting as a last line of defence against scammers who try to gain access to your accounts, such as through malware attacks. If you want access to the “locked-up” amount, you may need to visit a bank branch or ATM, or undergo additional verification. There may be processing time for unlocking these funds. &nbsp;</p><p>How it works&nbsp;</p><p>Let’s say you have $5,000 in your bank account but only need $1,000 for your day-to-day or regular expenses. You may “lock up” $4,000, leaving $1,000 that you can use via PayNow, transfers like GIRO payments, NETS transactions or ATM withdrawals.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Should scammers gain access to your account, the most they can steal is $1,000. They will not be able to spend or transfer out the “locked-up” $4,000.&nbsp;</p><p>[Append NCPC’s ACT KV for Money Lock]&nbsp;</p><p>How to set it up&nbsp;</p><p>The three local banks, DBS, OCBC, and UOB, offer this “Money Lock” feature.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Instructions for setting up can be found at:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>DBS digiVault [<a href="https://www.dbs.com.sg/personal/deposits/bank-with-ease/digivault" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.dbs.com.sg/personal/deposits/bank-with-ease/digivault</a>]&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>OCBC Money Lock [<a href="https://www.ocbc.com/personal-banking/security/secure-banking-ways/ocbc-moneylock.page" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.ocbc.com/personal-banking/security/secure-banking-ways/ocbc-moneylock.page</a>]&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>UOB LockAway [<a href="https://www.uob.com.sg/personal/save/lockaway-account.page" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.uob.com.sg/personal/save/lockaway-account.page</a>]&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p>[Append ABS’ FAQ on Money Lock feature]&nbsp;</p><p>Keep safe against scams&nbsp;</p><p>Avoiding scams starts with adopting good cyber hygiene habits.
