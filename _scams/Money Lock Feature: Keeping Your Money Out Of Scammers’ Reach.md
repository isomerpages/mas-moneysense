<p>Practising cyber hygiene is vital to avoid getting scammed. To guard against
scammers, consider “locking up” a portion of the money in your bank accounts.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The “locked-up” amount cannot be transferred out digitally by anyone,
acting as a last line of defence against scammers who try to gain access
to your accounts, such as through malware attacks. If you want access to
the “locked-up” amount, you may need to visit a bank branch or ATM, depending
on the bank.</p>
<p>There may be processing time for unlocking these funds. You should therefore
think carefully about how much you should lock. Take stock of your recurring
expenses and near-term needs before making your decision.</p>
<h4>How It Works&nbsp;</h4>
<p>Let’s say you have $5,000 in your bank account but only need $1,000 for
your day-to-day or regular expenses. You may “lock up” $4,000, leaving
$1,000 that you can easily access for daily expenses such as payments through
PayNow, GIRO, NETS and ATM withdrawals.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Should scammers gain access to your account, the most they can access
is the $1,000. They will not be able to spend or transfer out the $4,000
that has been “locked-up”.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please visit your bank's website for instructions on how to set up the
feature.</p>
<h4>Safeguarding Your CPF Savings</h4>
<p>If you are a CPF member aged 55 or older and do not intend to withdraw
your CPF savings anytime soon, you are encouraged to safeguard your CPF
savings by activating the CPF Withdrawal Lock which disables online CPF
withdrawals. You can easily activate the CPF Withdrawal Lock at any time
online under the <a href="https://www.cpf.gov.sg/member/ds/account-settings" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">CPF account settings</a> after
logging on to the CPF website using your Singpass.</p>
<p>When you need to make online CPF withdrawals, you can re-enable online
withdrawals by increasing the online Daily Withdrawal Limit via the CPF
account settings. For your security, this will be subject to enhanced authentication
measures and a 12-hour cooling period. Members who do not wish to enable
online withdrawals can make an appointment to withdraw in-person at CPF
Service Centres.</p>
