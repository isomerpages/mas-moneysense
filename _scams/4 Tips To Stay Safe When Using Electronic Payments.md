<h3>Common E-payment Methods Today</h3>
<p>E-payment is common in Singapore today. You can use it for&nbsp;dining,

<p>With the wide range of e-payment choices available, do you know what you
are signing up for and how you can protect yourself from unauthorised transactions?</p>
<p>Here are some common e-payment methods and safety tips:</p>

<p><strong>Debit/ Credit Cards</strong>– The traditional e-payment method
we are most familiar with.</p>
<p>You can hand over your physical debit or credit cards to pay at the supermarket
or a restaurant. You can store your debit or credit card details on your
phone to pay for your transport fare. Or you can also pay by keying in
using your debit or credit card when checking out your online shopping.</p>
<p>While these cards are typically issued by banks, some other non-bank players
like Singlife have started issuing debit cards.</p>

<p>Set and turn on notifications for your transactions.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>You should turn on SMS, email, or have your mobile push notifications
of your transactions so that you would be alerted to unauthorised transactions
promptly. You can do so via Internet banking.</p>

<li>
<p>You can choose the transaction value that would trigger a notification
- it can be as low as 1 cent.</p>

<p>Never reveal your OTP!</p>

<p>OTP, or One-Time Password, is a way to authenticate transactions. You
should safeguard OTP just as you keep your ATM PIN secret. Never share
it with anyone, not even your bank.</p>

<p><strong>E-wallets</strong>– If you have to top up a card or an account
before you can use it, you are using an e-wallet.</p>
<p>Some examples of e-wallets are: EZ-Link cards, which are used to pay for
train rides; PayLah!, can be used to transfer funds to your peers; or GrabPay,
which you can use to pay in stores.</p>
<p>When you make payment, money is deducted from the amount you have loaded
into the account.</p>

<p>Top up only the amount you need.</p>

<p>If you are using an e-wallet with a physical card, such as EZ-Link, your
money is gone if you lose your card.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some e-wallets do not come with physical cards. Instead, the e-wallet
is only on your mobile phone. If you lose your phone and it is not secured,
your e-wallets will be exposed to fraudulent transactions.</p>

<h4>How Do I Ensure That My Money And Accounts Are Kept Safe When Using E-payments?</h4>
<p>In general, looking after your money in e-payment accounts begins with
practicing good cyber hygiene. Much like how you would not leave cash lying
around in plain sight, it is important to take measures to ensure the money
in your e-payment accounts does not make for easy pickings.</p>
<p>Here are some good cyber hygiene practices:</p>

<p>You can lower the transaction value that triggers a notification to be
sent to you. This will allow you to detect unauthorised transactions even
if they are of low value. Taking measures to ensure your accounts are as
safe as possible could also help limit your liability in the event of unauthorised
transactions.</p>
<h4>What Should I Do If I Detect Unauthorised Transactions On My Account?</h4>
<p>You should report any unauthorised transactions to your bank or payment
service provider as soon as possible and provide as much information as
you can on any unauthorised transaction within a reasonable time. Your
bank or payment service provider may also ask you to file a police report
to facilitate the investigation process.</p>
