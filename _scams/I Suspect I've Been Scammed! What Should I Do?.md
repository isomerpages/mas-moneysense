<h3>Acting Fast To Prevent More Losses</h3>
<p>As soon as you realise you may have fallen for a scam, your first steps
should focus on stopping criminals from siphoning away more money.</p>
<p><strong>That means contacting your bank immediately to freeze your accounts, </strong>cancel
your cards and/ or e-wallets. Your bank may have implemented a "kill switch",
allowing you to freeze your own account.</p>
<p>Recovering your funds may not be possible all the time but if you respond
quickly, it should at least stop more money from flowing out of your accounts.</p>
<h4>Tip</h4>
<p>Major retail banks have either introduced dedicated fraud hotline numbers
or making it the first few options on the phone-banking menu for customers
seeking help for scams. Find out these numbers from official sources such
as the back of your bank ATM cards.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In some cases, scammers may try to continue conning you by promising to
release your funds once you send across some fees.</p>
<p>They may pretend to be government officials or bank employees and ask
for an upfront payment of fee to help you get back your stolen money.</p>
<p>Don't be duped! Once you suspect something is wrong, stop giving away
more money.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>Tip</h4>
<p>Turn on and monitor transaction notifications from your banks so that
you can detect unauthorised transactions in a timely manner.</p>
<h3>Report To The Police</h3>
<p>After securing your accounts, lodge a <a href="https://eservices1.police.gov.sg/phub/eservices/landingpage/police-report" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">police report online</a> or
at the nearest Neighbourhood Police Centre of Neighbourhood Police Post.</p>
<p>It is a good idea to report to the police while details are still fresh
in your mind. Reporting your case quickly will help the police launch investigations
early and potentially prevent more victims getting scammed. Your bank will
also need a copy of the police report as soon as practicable.</p>
<p>Some of the details that will be useful for investigations include the
date and time of the scam, the fraudulent website address or email address,
and phone numbers used by the scammers.</p>
<h3>Ways To Protect Yourself</h3>
<p>Don't blame yourself if you have fallen prey to a scam.</p>
<p>Scammers are very good at what they do and are always coming up with new
ruses.</p>
<h4>Tip</h4>
<p>Scammers have been known to put up online ads to direct unsuspecting individuals
to phishing websites made to look like bank websites.</p>
<p>Use your banking apps to transact. Alternatively, bookmark the correct
URL in your browser instead of googling for the address each time you want
to log in.</p>
<p></p>
<p>While additional security measures have been put in place to protect consumers
from scams, staying vigilant is critical.</p>
