<h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>All investments carry risks. Always check before you invest!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check for red flags. Be wary of opportunities that offer high returns
at little or no risk.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check that the company and its representatives are regulated by the Monetary
Authority of Singapore (MAS).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Out of nowhere, you are added to a group chat where people are sharing
their windfall from a not-to-be-missed investment.</p>
<p>Or you are contacted on social media, who asks if you are interested in
a lucrative investment opportunity.</p>
<p>It could even be an ad you chance upon on social media platforms touting
profitable "investment opportunities".</p>
<p>Sounds familiar?</p>
<p>Most of us would have read about news reports of people who were scammed
through such methods. Nevertheless, people continue to fall victim as scammers
constantly come up with new, convincing ways to steal what is often very
large amounts.</p>
<p>In many instances, victims thought they would never get scammed â€“ sometimes
they use the profits they receive initially to refute disbelieving loved
ones. But criminals have become extremely skilled at convincing people
that get-rich-quick scheme is real and high returns are within easy reach.</p>
<p>Always remember to Check Before You Invest if you want to safeguard your
hard-earned money! Here's what you should check:</p>
<h3>Check For Red Flags</h3>
<p>Scammers use sophisticated tactics to get you to part with your money.
There are red flags you can watch out for to steer clear of investment
scams.</p>
<h4>High Returns At Low Or No Risk</h4>
<p>Be wary when you encounter an investment opportunity that claims to guarantee
or protect your capital while promising high returns. The greater the promised
investment returns, the higher the risks should be. Many investment scams
use lucrative promises to lure investors in</p>
<h4>Pressure Tactics</h4>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>"Limited time only! Invest before it sells out!"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"Special rates for first 50 investors. Don't miss out on this golden opportunity!"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"More than 2,000 people have invested - what are you waiting for?"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"Invest today and get extra 10% credit with many other benefits."</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Limited offers, timed gifts or rebates, are common tactics in investment
scams to rush you into committing your money.</p>
<p>Make sure you fully understand what you are buying into instead of focusing
on the carrots dangled.</p>
<h4>Offer Of Commissions</h4>
<p>Legitimate investment schemes generally do not offer commissions to investors
for referrals.</p>
<p>Investment scams use such incentives to encourage existing customers to
bring in their friends and associates to quickly enlarge their investor
base.</p>
<h4>Fictitious Track Records</h4>
<p>Investment scams may claim to have many years of experience, multiple
accolades or simply large investment profits to gain trust.</p>
<p>Some use testimonials from "satisfied customers" to shore up their credibility.</p>
<p>You should approach claims with healthy skepticism. Where possible, verify
the claims with an independent third party.</p>
<h3>Check That The Entity Is Regulated</h3>
<p>Some investment scams may even claim to be regulated by the relevant authorities
to mislead you.</p>
<p>Confirm such claims by checking the resources on the Monetary Authority
of Singapore (MAS) website.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><a href="https://eservices.mas.gov.sg/fid" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Financial Institutions Directory</a>&nbsp;-
a list of financial institutions regulated by MAS and the regulated activities
they are authorised to provide</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://eservices.mas.gov.sg/rr" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Financial Institutions Representatives Register</a>&nbsp;-
a list of individuals who conduct activities regulated by MAS</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/ial" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Investor Alert List</a>&nbsp;-
a non-exhaustive list of persons unregulated by MAS who may have been wrongly
misperceived as being licensed or authorised by MAS</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember, <a href="https://www.moneysense.gov.sg/dealing-with-unregulated-persons/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">dealing with an unregulated entity </a>means
giving up the safeguards offered under the laws administered by MAS.</p>
<h3>Check On The Company's Background</h3>
<p>Do not be too quick to believe everything you are told. Verify information
provided by the entity about themselves or the investment opportunity,
such as the background of representatives and the entity's track record.</p>
<p>It is also important to ask the entity as many questions as you need to
fully understand the investment opportunity. If it is unable to answer
or avoids answering any of your questions, be wary.</p>
<p>If you suspect that you are a victim of scam, inform your bank and file
a police report immediately.</p>
<p>Tell your family and friends about investment scams so that they do not
fall prey to them.</p>
<p><strong>Remember, if an investment sounds too good to be true, it probably is.</strong>
