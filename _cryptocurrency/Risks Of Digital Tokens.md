<h3>What Are Digital Tokens?</h3>
<p>A digital token is a type of digital asset that is typically maintained
using blockchain technology. It can represent various things, such as something
of value, a medium of exchange, or a right to access a service.</p>
<p>Tokens are a string of computer codes. They are usually issued in pairs
as public and private keys.</p>
<p>There are three main types of digital tokens:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Payment tokens</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Securities tokens</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Utility tokens</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The most commonly known digital tokens are payment tokens, which are used,
or intended to be used, as a means of payment. This type of token is commonly
called “cryptocurrency"&nbsp;although it is not a “currency” issued by
any government. Bitcoin, Ether and Litecoin are examples of payment tokens.</p>
<h3>Risks Involving Payment Tokens/Cryptocurrencies</h3>
<p>MAS has cautioned that trading in cryptocurrencies and their derivatives
are not suitable for retail investors.</p>
<p>Here are some risks involving cryptocurrencies which you should be aware
of:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Speculative value: </strong>The value of cryptocurrencies is highly
volatile and not transparent. Often, they do not have any underlying value
attached, and trade on speculation, especially in the case of “meme coins”.
The traded price can fluctuate greatly in a short time and can become zero
overnight. It is possible to lose every cent you put in cryptocurrencies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Losing private key:</strong>&nbsp;If you lose your private key,
you lose access to your tokens. If someone hacks into your digital wallet
or otherwise knows of your private key, that person gains access to your
tokens.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Money-laundering and terrorist financing:</strong>&nbsp;Funds
invested into schemes carry a higher risk of being misused for illegal
activities due to the pseudonymous nature of the transactions. Investors
are likely to be adversely affected if authorities investigate any alleged
illicit activities related to the token issuer, its business activities,
or the trading of the token.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Insufficient secondary market liquidity:</strong>&nbsp;Even if
the tokens can be traded in a secondary market, you may be stuck with them
if there are not enough active buyers and sellers. Or if the bid-ask spreads
are too wide.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Authenticity of service providers: </strong>It is difficult to
trace and verify the authenticity of the operator of trading platforms
that are run online or outside Singapore. If a trading platform fails,
you could lose all your money. In addition, establishing the credibility
of token issuers could be hard. As with all start-ups, the failure rate
tends to be high.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>What Protection Do You Have?</h3>
<p>MAS will not be able to help you if you lose money from dealing with digital
tokens that are not products regulated by MAS, even if the digital token
service is provided by an entity regulated by MAS.</p>
<p>Some business conduct measures aimed at reducing consumer harm have been
introduced for cryptocurrency service providers. In addition, retail distribution
measures aim to provide retail customers with greater risk awareness, and
limit risks which they can take.</p>
<p>However, MAS' regulatory measures cannot shield consumers from the risk
of their cryptocurrency holdings losing value, or cryptocurrency service
providers collapsing (for example, due to unsustainable business models,
fraud, or excessive risk taking).</p>
<p>MAS does not license or regulate Decentralised Finance (DeFi) applications,
which can be used to engage in activities involving cryptocurrencies such
as trading, lending and borrowing, staking, and yield farming, without
the need for an intermediary or service provider.</p>
<p>You may not be able to recover any of the cryptocurrencies or monies that
you deposited with the service provider/ DeFi application if:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>They are stolen or lost due to hacking of your account, misappropriation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The service provider/ DeFi application becomes bankrupt</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You encounter problems withdrawing funds from the service provider/ DeFi
application</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Crypto derivatives (e.g., futures, options, or Contracts For Differences
(CFD) that reference cryptocurrencies) may be offered by brokers and cryptocurrency
service providers. Currently, MAS’ regulations on crypto derivatives only
apply to those listed on <a href="https://eservices.mas.gov.sg/fid/institution?sector=Capital%20Markets&amp;category=Approved%20Exchange" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Approved Exchanges</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Note:&nbsp;</strong>Be wary of fraudulent websites / unsolicited
chatgroups on messaging platforms promoting / soliciting cryptocurrency
investments by touting high returns or using fabricated comments attributed
to prominent public personalities. MAS and the Commercial Affairs Department
have issued several advisories warning of such incidents.</p>
<p>If you suspect that an investment offer could be fraudulent or misused
for other unlawful activities, report it to the Police.</p>
<h3>Checklist</h3>
<p>Before making any investment decision:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Seek financial services from persons or entities that are regulated</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make sure you fully understand the benefits and risks of the product or
service before committing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assess whether the product or service meets your needs and is suitable
for your appetite for risk</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Always check before you invest:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Check </strong>for red flags. Scammers use sophisticated tactics
to get you to part with your money. There are red flags you can watch out
for to steer clear of investment scams, such as high returns at low or
no risk.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Check </strong>that the platform that you are dealing with is
regulated. Confirm such claims by checking the resources on the Monetary
Authority of Singapore (MAS) website.</p>
