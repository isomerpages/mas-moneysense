<h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Payment token derivatives are highly risky products</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In general, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) does not view payment
token derivatives to be suitable for most retail investors to trade</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>What Are Digital Tokens?</h3>
<p>There are three main types of Digital Tokens:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Payment tokens;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Securities tokens; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Utility tokens.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The most commonly known are payment tokens which are used as a means of
payment. Bitcoin, Ether and Litecoin are examples of payment tokens. They
are not legal tender.</p>
<h3>Risks Of Trading Payment Tokens And Their Derivatives</h3>
<p>Trading of payment tokens and their derivatives has largely been on unregulated
markets where there have been allegations of fictitious trades and market
manipulation. If you trade unregulated products, you will not be protected
by regulations administered by MAS.</p>
<p>Payment tokens and their derivatives are not suitable for most retail
investors. These tokens tend to have little or no intrinsic value and are
difficult to value. Their prices also tend to fluctuate very widely.</p>
<p>You are advised to exercise extreme caution if you want to trade payment
token derivatives. You must be prepared to lose more than the amount you
put in due to the leveraged nature of derivatives such as futures.</p>
