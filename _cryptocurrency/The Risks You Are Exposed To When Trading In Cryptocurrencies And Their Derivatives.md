<h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Cryptocurrencies and their derivatives are unregulated except for cryptocurrency
derivatives, which are listed on Approved Exchanges licensed by MAS</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you trade in unregulated products, MAS is unable to help you if you
face difficulties in recovering your assets such as cryptocurrencies and
monies, or become a victim to unfair or manipulative practices</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Cryptocurrencies, also known as Digital Payment Tokens (DPTs), are tokens
which may be used to pay for certain goods and services.</p>
<p>Examples of such tokens include Bitcoin, Ether and Litecoin. These tokens
are not legal tender.</p>
<p>MAS licenses companies that offer services to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Change money into cryptocurrency;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Change cryptocurrency into money; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Exchange one type of cryptocurrency for another, including providing trading
services, brokerage services, operation of a market or platform that allows
customers to trade with each other</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These companies are licensed by MAS to address the risks of money laundering
and financing of terrorism. They are not required to put in place measures
to safeguard consumers’ money or cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>MAS does not license or regulate Decentralised Finance (DeFi) applications
which can be used by users to engage in activities involving cryptocurrencies
such as trading, lending and borrowing, staking, and yield farming, without
the need for an intermediary or service provider.</p>
<p>Therefore, if you trade in cryptocurrencies, you would not be protected
by MAS’ regulations, even if the company you are dealing with is licensed
by MAS. You are also not protected for activities on a DeFi application.
You may not be able to recover any of the cryptocurrencies or monies that
you deposited with the service provider/ DeFi application if</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>They are stolen or lost due to hacking of your account, misappropriation;
or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The service provider/ DeFi application is going bankrupt; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You encounter problems withdrawing funds from the DPT service providers/
DeFi application</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to these risks, DPTs are not suitable for retail investors
because they have no intrinsic value and are subject to sharp price swings
driven by speculation. There is also high risk of fraud or failure arising
from DPT service providers' unsustainable business models and excessive
risk taking.</p>
<p>Crypto derivatives are derivatives contracts such as futures, options,
or Contracts For Differences (CFD), that reference cryptocurrencies as
the underlying. These products may be offered by CFD brokers and DPT service
providers or traded on DeFi applications.</p>
<p>Currently, MAS’ regulations on crypto derivatives only apply to those
listed on the Singapore Approved Exchanges. Crypto derivatives traded on
DeFi applications are not regulated.</p>
<p>If you trade in crypto derivatives that are not listed on Approved Exchanges,
the money you deposited for trading in these derivatives is not protected
by MAS’ regulations.</p>
<p><strong>Should things go awry, you may not be able to recover your money, and you would not be protected by MAS’ regulations, even if the company you are dealing with is licensed by MAS.</strong>
