<p>Find out how digital tokens work and what you should do to protect yourself
from token-related scams.</p>
<h4>Key Takeaways</h4>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Cryptocurrencies are not regulated by the Monetary Authority of Singapore
(MAS) as they are not legal tender.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be aware of the risks of Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>What are Digital Tokens, Cryptocurrencies and ICOs</h4>
<p>A Digital Token is a cryptographically-secured representation of the token-holder’s
rights to receive a benefit or to perform specified functions.</p>
<p>Tokens are a string of computer codes. They are usually issued in pairs
as public and private keys.</p>
<p>Digital Tokens are typically marketed:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>As a means</strong>&nbsp;<strong>to pay</strong>&nbsp;<strong>for goods or services.</strong>&nbsp;This
type of token is commonly called a cryptocurrency&nbsp;although it is not
a “currency” issued by any government. It is also known as a "digital payment
token".&nbsp;Examples include Bitcoin and Ethereum.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>As a money-making opportunity.</strong>&nbsp;This could be an
opportunity to participate in a new technology business, and/ or receive
future returns. This type of token is commonly called an Initial Coin Offering
or ICO.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>How an ICO Works</h4>
<hr>
<p>An ICO is a public sale of a new Digital Token.</p>
<p>Sellers typically set out their business proposals in a “white paper”
with claims such as:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Raising funds to develop a new blockchain-based, decentralised platform.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Providing exciting opportunities to invest in technology, business or
assets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tokens that can be used to exchange for attractive benefits or monetary
returns.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tokens that can be used to pay for goods and services offered on the platform.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Appreciation of token value over time due to reasons such as limited number
of tokens.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Buyers typically pay for the new tokens by transferring commonly transacted
cryptocurrencies e.g. Bitcoin or Ether, to a wallet address provided by
the seller. Buyers may also be able to pay for the new tokens by transferring
fiat currency to a bank account provided by the seller.</p>
<h4>Risks involving digital tokens</h4>
<hr>
<p>Cryptocurrencies are not regulated by MAS. They are not legal tender or
securities. Persons that buy or sell cryptocurrencies, or facilitate the
exchange of cryptocurrencies may be regulated under the Payment Services
Act 2019 for money-laundering and terrorism financing risk only.</p>
<p>Offers of digital tokens that are securities may be regulated or exempted
under the Securities and Futures Act, e.g. if they are offered to accredited
or institutional investors only, or are exempted small offers and private
placements. These exemptions come with specific conditions such as advertising
restrictions.</p>
<p>Here are some risks involving digital tokens you should be aware of:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Foreign and online operators.</strong>&nbsp;It is difficult to
trace and verify the authenticity of the operator of schemes that are run
online or outside Singapore. If the scheme fails, you could lose all your
investments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Sellers without a proven track record</strong>. Establishing the
credibility of token sellers could be hard. As with all start-ups, the
failure rate tends to be high.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Insufficient secondary market liquidity.</strong>&nbsp;Even if
the tokens can be traded in a secondary market, you may be stuck with them
if there are not enough active buyers and sellers. Or if the bid-ask spreads
are too wide.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>It is possible to lose every cent.</strong>&nbsp;The value of
digital tokens is usually highly speculative and not transparent. The traded
price can fluctuate greatly in a short time and can become zero overnight.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Investments promising high returns.</strong>&nbsp;Be wary. Investments
with higher promised returns come with higher risks and could potentially
be fraudulent. Schemes that offer high referral commissions would increase
operating costs, which could lower the chances of achieving the promised
returns.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Money-laundering and terrorist financing.</strong>&nbsp;Funds
invested into ICO schemes carry a higher risk of being misused for illegal
activities due to the pseudo-anonymous nature of the transactions. Investors
are likely to be adversely affected if authorities investigate any alleged
illicit activities related to the token issuer, its business activities,
or the trading of the token.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Risk of losing private key.</strong>&nbsp;If you lose your private
key, you lose access to your digital tokens. If someone hacks into your
digital wallet or otherwise knows of your private key, that person gains
access to your digital tokens.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Is it regulated?</h4>
<hr>
<p><strong>There is no legislative protection.</strong>&nbsp;Remember, MAS
will not be able to help you in any way if you lose money from dealing
with digital tokens that are not products regulated by MAS. This includes
situations where the digital token service is provided by an entity regulated
by MAS, but where the digital token is not regulated by MAS.</p>
<p>If you choose to deal with an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.moneysense.gov.sg/articles/2018/11/dealing-with-unregulated-persons" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">unregulated person or entity</a>&nbsp;or
invest in unregulated products, you will not be protected under MAS regulations.
If you suspect that an investment scheme involving digital tokens could
be fraudulent or is being misused for any illicit activity, you should
report it to the police immediately.</p>
<p>As for cryptocurrencies, persons that buy or sell cryptocurrencies, or
facilitate the exchange of cryptocurrencies may be regulated under the
Payment Services Act 2019. However, they are not required to protect your
cryptocurrency, and are not required to ensure that each cryptocurrency
transaction is processed properly.&nbsp;MAS regulates cryptocurrency service
providers under the Payment Services Act 2019 mainly for money-laundering
and terrorism financing risk only.</p>
<h4>Note</h4>
<p>Your cryptocurrency service provider is required by law to give this risk
warning to you.</p>
<h4>For Licensees</h4>
<p><strong>RISK WARNING ON DIGITAL PAYMENT TOKEN SERVICES</strong>
</p>
<p>The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) requires us to provide this
risk warning to you as a customer of a digital payment token (DPT) service
provider.</p>
<p>Before you pay your DPT service provider any money or DPT, you should
be aware of the following.</p>
<p>1. Your DPT service provider is licensed by MAS to provide DPT services.
Please note that this does not mean you will be able to recover all the
money or DPTs you paid to your DPT service provider if your DPT service
provider’s business fails.</p>
<p>2. You should not transact in the DPT if you are not familiar with this
DPT. Transacting in DPTs may not be suitable for you if you are not familiar
with the technology that DPT services are provided.</p>
<p>3. You should be aware that the value of DPTs may fluctuate greatly. You
should buy DPTs only if you are prepared to accept the risk of losing all
of the money you put into such tokens.</p>
