<p><strong>Find out about the types of home loans available and how interest is calculated, and learn about repayments and refinancing.</strong>
</p>
<h4>Key Takeaways</h4>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The HDB Loan Eligibility (HLE) letter and property loan fact sheet contain
the terms of your loan and show how rising interest rates could affect
your repayments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For bank loans, variable rates will kick in after the fixed rate lock-in
period ends (differs by loan package).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Refinancing a home loan may help you save on the interest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Making a partial pre-payment can help you lower your monthly loan payments
and save on the interest as well.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>What is a Home Loan?</h4>
<hr>
<p>An HDB loan or home loan is money borrowed from HDB or the bank to help
you buy your property. For HDB flats, you may also be able to tap on housing
loans at a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/news-and-publications/publications/hdbspeaks/housing-loan-at-a-concessionary-interest-rate" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">concessionary interest rate</a>,
subject to HDB's criteria.</p>
<p>With a home loan:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Your property is used as collateral for the loan</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The amount granted is based on eligibility</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The loan is disbursed after the downpayment is made, when you pay the
remaining purchase price to the seller</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Interest is charged from the first disbursement</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Who is Eligible for a Home Loan?</h4>
<hr>
<p>HDB and the banks will have their own eligibility criteria for prospective
borrowers. These include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Minimum monthly income</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Buyer's minimum and maximum age</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Loan quantum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Residency status</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fulfilment of the Monetary Authority of Singapore’s property loan rules
and HDB's/ the bank’s internal credit requirements</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are self-employed or do not have a regular income, you must demonstrate
the ability to service monthly instalments to be eligible for a loan. Each
lender will assess your eligibility based on its criteria.</p>
<h4>Types of Home Loans</h4>
<hr>
<p>HDB offers a concessionary loan for HDB buyers only, at an interest rate
that is pegged at 0.1% above the CPF Ordinary Account interest rate. This
interest rate is revised in line with the revision of CPF interest rates.</p>
<p>For banks, there are two main types of home loans:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Fixed-rate loans</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Floating or variable rate loans</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's how they compare:</p>
<p><strong>Fixed-rate Loans</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Rate is fixed and will not change for the first few years (promotional
rate).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rate does not change even when market rates fall.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After a fixed rate period, interest becomes variable.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Floating or variable rate loans</strong>
</p>
<p>*Rate varies and is usually tied to a reference rate e.g. CPF Ordinary
Account, Singapore Interbank Offered Rate (SIBOR), Singapore Swap Offered
Rate (SOR) or a rate determined by the bank (e.g. internal board rate).</p>
<p>*If the reference rate goes up, the interest payable will increase and
vice versa.</p>
<p>The reference rate can change at any time, depending on the prevailing
market conditions. Banks must inform you in advance (usually 30 days) before
they change the interest rate on your housing loan.</p>
<p>To understand the differences of the various bank loan packages better,
ask your bank to explain:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>How the reference rate is derived</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How often this interest rate may be reset</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Under what circumstances the rate is changed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What special features, if any, apply and if these will be removed or amended
later</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;A promotional rate is lower than the rate
for the remainder of the loan. Make sure you know how much your monthly
payments will increase when the promotional period is over.</p>
<h4>How interest is computed</h4>
<hr>
<p>The common method of calculating interest is monthly reducing (monthly
rest).</p>
<p>Even a small increase in interest rates can affect your monthly instalment
and the effective interest rate that you will end up paying for your loan.</p>
<p>To illustrate, here's what happens to the monthly instalment for an S$800,000
30-year loan at different interest rates using monthly rest method:</p>

<h3>Tip</h3>
<p>Even if you are eligible for a bigger loan or a longer loan tenure, do
not take it up unless you are sure you will have the resources to fund
it.</p>
<h4>What you can do: Pre-pay your home loan</h4>
<p>You can consider making a lump sum pre-payment on your home loan to reduce
your monthly payments and save on interest over the long run. Be sure to
check if there are any penalties first.</p>
<p><strong>Example: Partial pre-payment</strong>
</p>
<p>If you have an outstanding home loan of $800,000 over 25 years, and you
make a one-time partial prepayment:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">

</tbody>
</table>
<p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;Assuming that the home loan interest rate
rises to 5% per annum and remains at that level for the remaining loan
tenure of 25 years. Subject to the terms and conditions of your home loan
— check with your lender.</p>
<h4>All about your loan</h4>
<hr>
<p>Check the HDB Home Loan Eligibility Letter (HLE) and property loan factsheet
for more details about your home loan.</p>
<h4>HDB Loan Eligibility Letter</h4>
<p>To find out if you are eligible for an HDB loan and the maximum amount
you can borrow, you will need to apply for an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/buying-a-flat/financing-a-flat-purchase/application-for-an-hdb-loan-eligibility-hle-letter/hdb-loan-eligibility-hle-letter" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">HDB Loan Eligibility (HLE)</a>&nbsp;letter.</p>
<p>HLE helps you plan for your home purchase by giving you information on
how much you can borrow, the monthly repayments, the amount of cash you
need and other terms and conditions.</p>
<h4>Tip</h4>
<p>An HDB loan comes with certain eligibility criteria such as an income
ceiling. <a href="https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/buying-a-flat/understanding-your-eligibility-and-housing-loan-options/flat-and-grant-eligibility" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Check if you qualify.</a>
</p>
<h4>Property loan fact sheet</h4>
<p>Before you sign up for a home loan with a bank, the bank must provide
you with a property loan fact sheet.</p>
<p>It highlights how possible increases in interest rates will affect your
monthly instalments, and contains the key features of the loan, including:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Loan amount and tenure</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Total repayment amount</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lock-in period</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Interest rate and repayment schedule</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rate change illustration</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Effective interest rate</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Penalty fees</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Ask your bank to take you through the fact sheet so that you know what
you are committing to when you take up the loan.</p>
<h4>Refinancing and repricing</h4>
<hr>
<p>Refinancing means switching from your existing home loan to a new lender
with lower interest rates. Refinancing at your current bank is called repricing,
or conversion.</p>
<p>You should review your home loan regularly to see if you can save money
by refinancing, particularly if your lock-in period is over.</p>
<p>Note: HDB flat buyers are not allowed to refinance their existing bank
loan with an HDB loan.</p>
<h4>Before you refinance</h4>
<p>Before refinancing, consider if you are better off:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Sticking to your current housing loan package</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Converting to a different housing loan package with your existing bank</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Taking up a refinanced housing loan package with a different bank</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Go through these steps to check and compare your options:</p>
<p><strong>1. Check with your current bank</strong>
</p>
<p>Ask your existing bank for repricing options, before checking with other
banks. Check whether the lock-in period still applies to your loan. If
so, certain penalties may apply.</p>
<p>Ask your bank the following questions:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Will I incur a fee for terminating my current housing loan package e.g.
penalties within the lock-in period, claw backs, additional legal fees
or conversion fees?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can I convert the loan to one which is more attractively priced? What
charges are involved?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is there a lock-in period for the new housing loan package? If so, how
long is it and what charges are involved?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can you show me how I will be better off with the refinanced package?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Compare loan packages</strong>
</p>
<p>It's always a good idea to compare the repriced loan from your current
bank with other refinancing packages to see if you should switch. You should
compare:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The updated repayment schedules for the various packages – check the interest
payable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The advertised rates and effective interest rate (EIR) for the packages.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Your instalment amounts and interest rates will likely change if you change
your loan package. Banks are required to provide you with a residential
property fact sheet to explain the key features of the loan package. Take
this opportunity to ask questions such as the penalty fees for early loan
repayment, or bundled products, such as mortgagee interest policy, and
compare with other loan packages to understand the differences.</p>
<p><strong>3. Read the fine print</strong>
</p>
<p>Before committing to a refinanced housing loan package:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Read the terms and conditions and understand what the new package offers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cpf.gov.sg/member/faq/home-ownership/housing-scheme/how-much-cpf-savings-can-i-use-for-my-property-purchase" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">CPF Housing Withdrawal Limit</a>&nbsp;applicable
to you when you refinance your housing loan.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>What if you can't pay?</h2>
<p>If you have trouble keeping up with your monthly payments, approach your
mortgagee quickly (HDB or the bank). HDB may be able to better advise you
on alternative options while the bank may be able to help you restructure
the loan.</p>
<p>Your home loan is secured against your property. In case of a loan default,
HDB or the bank has a first charge and the CPF Board has a second charge
on your property, if CPF savings have been used for downpayment or to service
the loan.</p>
<p>If you fail to make the home loan payments when they are due, the first
charge allows HDB or the bank to sell your home and use the sales proceeds
to pay off what you owe the bank.</p>
<p>The CPF Board is entitled to the remaining sales proceeds to recover what
has been deducted from your CPF OA.</p>
<h4>Tip</h4>
<p>If you are using CPF to service your housing instalments, it makes sense
to pay off the loan&nbsp;<strong>by the CPF withdrawal age of 55,</strong>&nbsp;due
to the lower CPF contributions from age 50 onwards. With lower contributions
to your Ordinary Account, you may have to use more cash for the loan repayments.</p>
