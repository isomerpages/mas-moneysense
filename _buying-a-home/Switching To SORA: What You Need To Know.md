<p>SORA will be replacing SOR and SIBOR as the key interest rate benchmark
for Singapore Dollar loans and other financial products.</p>
<p>Existing borrowers on SOR or SIBOR loans will need to switch out to a
new loan package. &nbsp;Affected borrowers can choose from packages that
reference the Singapore Overnight Rate Average (SORA) or other prevailing
packages offered by their banks.</p>
<h3>What Is SORA?</h3>
<p>SORA is the volume-weighted average borrowing rate in Singapore's unsecured
overnight interbank cash market.&nbsp; It has been administered by the
Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) since 2005.</p>
<p>SORA loan packages are priced using the compounded average of the daily
SORA rate over one, three, or six months. Because the calculation for interest
payments is based on SORA over an average over a period, the interest rate
applied to such loans tend to be less volatile.</p>
<p>In contrast, interest payments on SIBOR-based and SOR-based loans are
determined by the prevailing rate on a single day and could change abruptly
in the event of interest rate fluctuations on interest reset dates.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>SOR is the effective rate of borrowing Singapore
dollars synthetically, by borrowing US dollars and converting them to Singapore
dollars in the foreign exchange market. SIBOR is what a bank estimates
it will have to pay another bank to borrow Singapore dollars. It is calculated
based on daily submissions by a panel of contributor banks and may not
be always fully backed by transactions.</p>
<p>Unlike SIBOR, which is based on estimates from Singapore banks, SORA is
based on transaction data and is published at 9am daily.</p>
<p>The impending discontinuation of SOR and SIBOR is in line with a shift
in financial markets worldwide towards interest rate benchmarks that are
computed based on transaction data. For instance, SOR which relies on USD
LIBOR in its computation, will be discontinued after 30 June 2023, alongside
the discontinuation of USD LIBOR.</p>
<p>SOR and SIBOR will be replaced by SORA.</p>
<h3>What To Expect</h3>
<p><strong>For SOR Borrowers</strong>
</p>
<p>There are two options: (1) the SORA Conversion Package or (2) other loan
packages offered by your bank.</p>
<p><u>Option 1: SORA Conversion Package</u>
</p>
<p>If you haven’t switched out of your SOR residential loan package, your
bank will automatically convert you to the SORA Conversion Package in October
2022 so that there is no disruption to your loan when SOR is discontinued.
The bank will do this by:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Your bank will switch your SOR loan to a SORA loan by applying a standardised
Adjustment Spread (Retail) on your original loan margin. An adjustment
spread is necessary to account for term and credit risks, which SOR factors
in but SORA does not&nbsp;– this is why SORA is typically lower than SOR.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Adjustment Spread (Retail) is computed based on the average difference
between SOR and 3-month SORA compounded-in-advance over the last three
months, subject to a floor of zero.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will incur no additional fee or lock-in if you switch to the SORA
Conversion Package offered by your existing bank.&nbsp;</p>
</li>

<p><u>Option 2:&nbsp;Other loan packages offered by your bank</u>
</p>
<p>You may also choose to take up other loan packages offered by your bank,
such as fixed rate property loans or floating rate property loan based
on banks’ board rate or fixed deposit rates.</p>
<p>You can switch to any other loan package your bank is offering even if
your SOR loan has been automatically converted to the SORA Conversion Package.</p>
<p>As SOR and the relevant Adjustment Spread (Retail) has risen sharply over
the past few months driven by the global rising interest rate environment,
other prevailing loan packages which your bank offers could provide more
attractive rates<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">.</a>
</p>
<p>Using an example (see table below) where the bank is offering a loan package
based on 3-month compounded SORA with a 1% spread, you could get a lower
all-in interest rate by switching out of the SORA Conversion Package to
the prevailing package. You may wish to compare the all-in interest rate
and whether there is a lock-in period – to make your decision.</p>

<p><strong>Note: </strong>To facilitate industry-wide transition, the Mortgage
Servicing Ratio (MSR) and Total Debt Servicing Ratio (TDSR) will not need
to be re-computed for affected borrowers switching to a SORA package with
the same financial institution. If you initiate a refinancing of your property
loan with another financial institution (which will be subject to the financial
institution's terms and conditions), you should check if any other TDSR
exemptions apply. For example, borrowers who are owner-occupiers are exempted
from TDSR when refinancing their property loans.</p>
<p><strong>For SIBOR Borrowers</strong>
</p>
<p>For borrowers on loans that reference 1-month or 3-month SIBOR<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">,</a> there is no immediate impact to
your loan as&nbsp;details of your loan conversion will be released in due
course, as these benchmarks will only be discontinued after 31 December
2024.</p>
<h3>Key Dates To Note</h3>
<p><strong>30 June 2023 -&nbsp;</strong>SOR will be discontinued</p>
<p><strong>31 Dec 2024 -&nbsp;</strong>1-month and 3-month SIBOR will be
discontinued</p>
