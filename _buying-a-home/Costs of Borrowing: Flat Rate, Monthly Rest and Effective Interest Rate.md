<p><strong>Look beyond the advertised interest rate. Learn about different types of loans and what factors affect how much interest you will end up paying.</strong>
</p>
<h4>Key Takeaways</h4>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Loans are not free money and must be repaid with interest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Usually, you pay more interest for a loan with a longer tenure than for
one with a shorter tenure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use the effective interest rate to compare different loans to get the
best rate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check the repayment schedule before signing up.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Before taking out a loan, think about the interest payments. Apart from
the interest rate, consider the processing fees, legal costs and other
charges due to late or non-payment.</p>
<p>Remember, for the same amount borrowed, you pay more interest for a longer
loan period than for a shorter loan period.</p>
<h4>How Interest Rates are Calculated</h4>
<p>Not all loans work the same way. Learn about flat and monthly rest rates,
and how they affect interest calculations.</p>
<h5>Flat Rate</h5>
<p>With a flat rate, interest payments are calculated based on the original
loan amount. The monthly interest stays the same throughout, even though
your outstanding loan reduces over time.</p>
<p>A flat rate is commonly used for car loans and personal term loans.</p>
<h5>Car Loan</h5>
<p>Below is a calculation for a $90,000 car loan at 2.5% interest per annum
flat rate. Notice that you will end up paying more interest for a 7-year
loan than for a 5-year loan.</p>

<h5>Monthly Rest Rate</h5>
<p>With monthly rest, interest is calculated based on the outstanding balance
of the loan. As you pay down your outstanding loan amount every month,
the interest also reduces over time.</p>
<p>Monthly Rest Rate is commonly used for home loans.</p>
<h5>Loan on Monthly Rest</h5>
<p>Say you have a $600,000 loan payable over 20 years at a fixed rate of
3.5% per annum and you have to make 240 equal monthly repayments of $3,480.</p>
<p>Here's what your payment schedule might look like for the first five years.
Notice that the interest portion of the payment reduces as time goes on.</p>

<h5>Fixed versus Floating Rate</h5>
<p>For a fixed rate monthly rest, the interest rate stays the same for a
period of time known as the lock-in period.</p>
<p>For a floating rate, the interest rate can move up or down. If interest
rate moves up, your interest expense will be higher. Do factor this in
when deciding if you can afford a loan.</p>
<h5>Effective interest rate (EIR) - what your loan actually costs</h5>
<p>The true cost of your loan is known as the effective interest rate (EIR),
which may be higher than the advertised rate because of the way interest
is calculated.</p>
<p>*For flat rate loans, the EIR is higher than the advertised rate because
the same rate (advertised rate) is applied throughout the loan period,
based on the original loan amount.</p>
<p>*For monthly rest loans, the advertised rate is the same as the EIR, because
interest is calculated based on the reduced balance of the loan.</p>
<p>Also, note that that the <strong>frequency of payments</strong> may also
affect the EIR. Think about 2 loans with the same principal amount, interest
and duration. The loan with smaller, more frequent instalments will be
more costly than one with fewer but larger instalments.</p>
<h5>Example: How payment frequency affects EIR</h5>
<p>For a $1,000 loan, repayable over a year with interest of $200, the EIR
will vary depending on the repayment schedule:</p>

<h4>Comparing loans</h4>
<p>Ask your bank for the advertised and effective interest rates. You can
use EIR to compare different loan packages to find out which one costs
the least.</p>
<p>The higher the EIR, the more interest you will be paying.</p>
<p>However, you may not always want to choose the loan with the lowest EIR.
For instance, if you intend to repay early, you may take a loan with a
higher EIR, but without any early repayment penalty.</p>
<h4>Deciding on a repayment plan</h4>
<p>Apart from the interest, you'll also need to consider your ability to
meet the monthly repayment when choosing the loan tenure.</p>
<p>Generally, a shorter loan tenure means less interest overall, but a higher
monthly repayment (and vice versa). Are you able to keep up the payments
for the entire loan period?</p>
<p>To help you decide, ask your bank for a <strong>repayment schedule</strong>.
It will give you an idea of the total borrowing costs (including the total
interest payable).</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you take up a floating-rate loan, keep in mind
that <strong>interest rates can go up</strong>. Even small increases can
make a big difference in the total amount you pay, so plan accordingly.</p>
<h4>Other costs of loans</h4>
<p>Loans may come with other costs such as fees, charges and third-party
costs, which could add up. You may need to factor these into your calculations.</p>
