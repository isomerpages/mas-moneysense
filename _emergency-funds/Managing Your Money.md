<p>How you manage your money can make a big impact on your life.</p>
<p>A good job and a dream income could still be insufficient if we do not
know how to handle our money. The key to being financially secure is not
how much money we make but how well we manage it.</p>
<h3>Start by Saving First</h3>
<p>Saving first and spending later is a good way to increase your savings.
It is a commitment to save a fixed amount every time you get paid. You
should keep this amount in a separate bank account so that you are not
tempted to spend it.</p>
<h5>Save First versus Spend First</h5>
<p>Here's the difference between the two spending patterns:</p>

<th rowspan="1" colspan="1">

</tr>
<tr>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>Save first and spend what's left</p>
</td>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>Savings first, must-pay bills, lifestyle expenses</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>Spend first and maybe, save later</p>
</td>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>Must-pay bills and lifestyle expenses first</p>
<p>Savings, if there's money left</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Saving first ensures that you save a portion of your income every month.
Ideally, you should save at least 20% of your income every month. For the
rest of your income, use a budget to help you manage your expenses.</p>
<p>Conversely, a spend-first-save-later pattern could mean there is nothing
left for savings.</p>

<h3>How Do You Spend?</h3>
<p>Before you start tracking your spending, take an honest look at how you
spend your money.</p>
<h5>Needs versus Wants</h5>
<p>Needs are the essentials of life. These are things you cannot live without,
like food or utilities.</p>
<p>Wants are the things you desire. They could be more expensive (but not
necessarily better) substitutes for your needs or just non-essential items,
like a new pair of shoes to add to your collection.</p>
<p>As a guideline, always prioritise spending on your needs over your wants:
What you want can wait until you have met your goals!</p>
<p>For example, think about something you bought recently. Do you know how
much you spent on it? Was it a need or want? Was it an essential item or
was it bought on impulse? Do you usually buy at first sight? Or do you
compare prices to see if you are getting the best deal?</p>
<p>You should take steps to curb your spending if it is keeping you from
achieving your goals.</p>

<p>A simple way to track your spending is by using a budgeting app. Or you
could jot down what you spent, when and how much you paid for it.</p>
<h3>Setting a Budget</h3>
<p>A budget is a good savings and spending plan. It can help you manage your
savings, income, spending, debt and other liabilities prudently. Setting
up a budget is also a great way to get a quick snapshot of where your money
is coming from and going.</p>
<p>Preparing a budget will help you:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Live within your means and meet your basic living expenses</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Track your spending, so you can put aside money for your long-term and
short-term goals</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Control your money, so that it does not end up controlling you</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have an existing budget, review it from time to time to make sure
it still works. If you are new to budgeting, use the Budget Calculator
to guide you.</p>
<h5>Checklist</h5>
<p>Here are a few tips to get you started on preparing a budget:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Work out your total monthly income. Include income you can count on (basic
salary, rental income). Do not include any money you are not sure you will
earn (e.g. bonuses and commissions).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Set aside a fixed amount of savings every month. Save first: Aim to save
at least 20% of your monthly take-home pay, or more if you can. Set aside
3 to 6 times of your monthly expenses as emergency funds. After you have
built up emergency savings, save up for the other goals you have in life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make a list of all monthly expenses. Include taxes, debts (any credit
facility, like loan repayments or credit card balances), transportation,
utilities, shopping, food and necessities. If you have children and elderly
parents who are dependent on you, include their allowance or financial
help. Add in amounts set aside for insurance premiums, investments and
savings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Set up a budget and follow it in a disciplined manner. Expenses may be
budgeted but we need not spend it if we don't need to.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Monitor your budget regularly to see if you are on track. Adjust your
budget if, for example, you get a pay rise or get a pay cut or if you have
another addition to the family.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>If you're spending too much</h3>
<p>Look for ways to reduce your expenses. Here are some ideas:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Change to house brands when shopping for food or essential household items</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Opt for the bus or train instead of taxis</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stop buying items you donâ€™t need</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have more home-cooked meals instead of eating out</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Review monthly subscriptions that you may no longer need</p>
</li>
</ul>
