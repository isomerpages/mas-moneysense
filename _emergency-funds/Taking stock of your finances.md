Do you spend more than you earn? Before you start managing your money, take a closer look at your current cashflow.

You need a clear understanding of where your money is going, to assess the health of your finances.

### Keeping track of your income and expenses
Take these steps to have a better idea of where your money goes:

**1. List down all the income sources**

Make a note of:

*   Your salary
*   Interest earned from savings
*   Income from investments, such as dividends and coupon payments

**2. Make a second list of your expenses**

Write down:

*   Your household and personal expenses
*   Loan repayments (e.g. housing loans, car loans)
*   Credit card bills
*   Health and life insurance premiums
*   Taxes, etc.

**3. Add up the expenses**

How much of your income is left over after your expenses? If your income is not enough to cover your expenses, examine your spending habits to see if you need to cut back.

Now that we have a good idea of what we spend our money on, let's take a look at how we can manage our money to meet our needs and goals.
