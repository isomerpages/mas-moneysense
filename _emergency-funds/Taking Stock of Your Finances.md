<p>Do you spend more than you earn? Before you start managing your money,
take a closer look at your current cashflow.</p>
<p>You need a clear understanding of where your money is going to assess
the health of your finances.</p>
<h3>Keeping Track of Your Income and Expenses</h3>
<p>Take these steps to have a better idea of where your money goes:</p>
<p><strong>1. List down all the income sources</strong>
</p>
<p>Make a note of:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Your salary</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Interest earned from savings</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Income from investments such as dividends and coupon payments</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Make a second list of your expenses</strong>
</p>
<p>Write down:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Your household and personal expenses</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Loan repayments (e.g. housing loans, car loans)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Credit card bills</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Health and life insurance premiums</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Taxes etc.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Add up the expenses</strong>
</p>
<p>How much of your income is left after your expenses? If your income is
not enough to cover your expenses, examine your spending habits to see
if you need to cut back.</p>
<p>Now that we have a good idea of what we spend our money on, let's take
a look at how we can manage our money to meet our needs and goals.</p>
