Should I buy a car or consider other ways of commuting? These resources can help you decide on what works best for you.

**Key points**

*   Compare the cost of owning a car and using public transport.
*   A car is generally a depreciating asset. Check ahead to estimate how much you can resell your car for.
*   Take out a car loan only if you can afford the monthly repayments, motor insurance, maintenance cost and are willing to accept the depreciation of the car's value.
