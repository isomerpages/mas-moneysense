Your property is probably the biggest purchase you will make. Do you know how to determine if you can afford the property youâ€™re eyeing?

Key points

*   Buying a home is a long-term commitment that requires careful planning.
*   How much you can borrow depends on your age and existing liabilities, among other things.
*   Review your loan regularly to see if re-financing can help you save on interest.
