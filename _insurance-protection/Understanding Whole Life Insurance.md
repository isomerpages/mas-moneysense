<p>Whole life insurance provides life-long protection. It is available in
different forms such as participating and non-participating policies.</p>
<h4>Participating Whole Life Policies</h4>
<p>Participating whole life policies share in the profits of the companyâ€™s
participating fund. Your share of the profit is paid in the form of bonuses
or dividends to your policy.</p>
<p>Bonuses or dividends are not guaranteed as they depend mainly on the investment
performance of the participating fund. When you make a claim, bonuses or
dividends which have been declared will be paid in addition to the sum
assured.</p>
<p>Whole life policies have cash values which will build up after a minimum
period, and this differs from product to product.</p>
<h4>Non-participating Whole Life Policies</h4>
<p>Non-participating whole life policies have guaranteed claims benefits
and cash values.</p>
<p>Compare participating and non-participating whole life policies. Decide
what features and benefits match your needs and buy the product that best
meets them.</p>
<h3>Things To Note</h3>
<p>Before buying a whole life product, ask yourself if you need to provide
for your dependents for the rest of your life or until they are financially
self-reliant.</p>
<p>Buying a life insurance policy is a long-term commitment. Early termination
causes you to lose money. Can you afford the premium?</p>
