When it comes to choosing life insurance, you have many options. Before asking which product is right for you, ask yourself why you want to be insured. Knowing this will help you narrow down your search for a suitable policy.

Do you want to:

* Provide for your loved ones when you are no longer around?
* Reduce financial loss due to illness or injury?
* Protect, save and invest your money for retirement?
* Leave behind some money for your loved ones as part of your estate?

Life insurance products fall under 2 broad categories: for protection only, and for protection and investment.

### For protection only
#### Term insurance

Term insurance is the simplest protection product that is usually the most affordable. It provides insurance coverage for a fixed period. An example of term insurance is the Dependants' Protection Scheme.

Buy term insurance if you only need protection coverage for a fixed period of time. For example, you want to be covered until your youngest child completes university or is financially self-reliant.

### For protection and investment
#### Whole life policy (participating and non-participating)

Whole life insurance policies provide life-long protection and also build savings which are subject to investment risk.

#### Endowment policy

Endowment policies are often marketed as a form of savings to help you meet a specific financial goal, such as paying for your childrenâ€™s education, or building up a pool of savings over a fixed term.

However, they're not like deposits. You may not get back what you put in. A small part of your payments will pay for the insurance coverage, while the rest is invested and subject to investment risk.

#### Investment-linked policy (ILP)

ILPs have both a life insurance and an investment component. Premiums are used to pay for units in the sub-funds of your choice. Some of the units that you buy are then sold to pay for insurance coverage and for other fees and charges, while the rest remain invested.

#### Annuity policy
An annuity provides a retirement income as it guarantees fixed payments at monthly intervals, for as long as the policyholder lives, or for a fixed period.

#### Riders

Riders may be offered to enhance the benefits of the original policy, e.g. coverage for critical illnesses. Additional premiums have to be paid for the riders and the premiums could increase with age.

### Term versus bundled products
Compare both types of products as each product fulfils a specific purpose. Decide what features and benefits match your needs and buy the product that best meets them.
