<h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Compound interest is interest earned on top of interest</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Rule of 72 helps you estimate how long it will take to double an investment
at a given rate</p>

</ul>
<h3>What is compound interest?</h3>
<p>Compound interest is interest earned on top of interest already earned.
As you earn interest, it gets added to your principal amount, which together
earns you more interest over time. If you start early, your investments
will be able to compound over a longer time period. The earliest returns
are reinvested for the longest time and therefore generate greater returns.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong>
</p>
<p>Consider a $100 investment that earns 4% every year compounded.</p>

<p>As you can see, the interest earned grows each year as the base amount
grows, creating a snowball effect.</p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>Compound interest can also work against you <a href="https://www.moneysense.gov.sg/understanding-credit-card-interest-and-charges" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">when it comes to debt</a>.</p>
<h3>Rule of 72</h3>
<p>Given a certain compound interest rate, how many years will it take to
double my money? That's a question the Rule of 72 can help you solve easily.</p>
<p>When you divide 72 by the interest rate number, you will get the number
of years required to double your money.</p>
<p>So if the interest rate is 4% p.a., 72/4 = 18 years. It will take 18 years
to double the money under a 4% interest rate.</p>
<h3>What does this mean for you?</h3>
<p>Always pay your debt payments in full and on time before they compound.
Start saving and investing early so your money has more time to grow.</p>
