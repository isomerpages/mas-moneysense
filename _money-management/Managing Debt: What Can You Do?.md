<p>The weight of debt can add emotional, relational and financial stress
to our lives.</p>
<p>Good money habits can help you avoid falling into the debt trap. This
is important as a good credit repayment history makes it easier for you
to obtain credit and qualify for loans when you really need it.</p>
<h3>Avoiding The Debt Trap</h3>
<p>Here are some ways you can tweak your habits to avoid or reduce debt.</p>
<p>When paying your bills or loans:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Pay off high-interest loans and credit facilities first</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use GIRO to automatically pay your bills, so you don't forget to make
payments</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avoid credit card fees and charges by paying your bills in full before
the due date</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When spending money:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Save up for big ticket items instead of <a href="https://www.moneysense.gov.sg/buy-now-pay-later/real-cost-instalment-payment-plan/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">buying on instalment</a>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don't shop on impulse; compare prices before buying</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use cash or a debit card to shop</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avoid people who pressure you to spend</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If your debt on all credit cards and unsecured credit facilities with
FIs exceeds 12 times your monthly income for three consecutive months,
you will <a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/regulation/explainers/ongoing-credit-checks-and-requirements" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">not be able to get additional credit facilities and your existing credit line(s) will be suspended</a>.</p>

<h3>Paying Off Your Debts</h3>
<p>Remember: <strong>Pay off the debt with the highest interest first. </strong>If
you have credit card debt, other unsecured loans or instalment plans, follow
these steps to pay them off as quickly as possible. Repeat until your debts
are paid off:</p>
<p>1. Order your outstanding loans by interest rates.</p>
<p>2. Pay off the full amount with the highest interest rate.</p>
<p>3. If you have trouble paying the full amount, pay it off in parts. Save
and pay till it's paid off.</p>
<p>4. When you have money to spare e.g. after receiving a bonus, increase
your regular repayments or make lump sum payments. Check if there are penalty
charges or if you need to give your FI advance notice.</p>
<p>5. Go back to Step 1 and start over. Keep going till you pay off all your
loans.</p>
<p>To better manage your cash flow, adopt the following good habits:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Draw up a budget – List out your monthly income and family expenses, and
see what expenses you can trim to repay your debts faster. Cut out indulgences
like eating out if you have trouble paying your bills.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Review your debts– Avoid having many sources of credit. It is easier to
keep track of repayments when you have fewer credit facilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pay on time – Make your repayments on time to avoid interest and late
charges. If you have difficulty making the repayments, talk to your FI.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<h3>What If You Can't Pay?</h3>
<p>Speak to your FI immediately. They may be able to help you restructure
your payments.</p>
<p>If you can't keep up with repayments:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Your credit score will be affected. Your credit score forms part of your
credit report which, alongside other considerations, is used by lenders
to assess the creditworthiness of borrowers before approving a new credit
facility</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Late payments may lower your chances of getting a loan in the future,
or require you to pay a higher interest rate for a loan</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The bank will take increasingly severe measures if you ignore them</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Work With Your FI</h3>
<p>Do not avoid calls or letters from your FI, its lawyers or debt collectors.
Talk to them as soon as possible. Remain co-operative and contactable.
If you are co-operative, your FI will be better able to help you restructure
your payment schedule.</p>
<h3>If You Have Multiple Debts</h3>
<p>Don't give up – you can improve your debt situation. Here are steps you
can take:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Review your credit report regularly to be aware of any information that
is uploaded on your credit file</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Talk to your FI. See if you can convert your outstanding credit and unsecured
loans into a debt repayment plan, where you can repay your debt by instalments</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not borrow from other sources to pay off your debts without first comparing
the interest charges and fees</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Refrain from charging more to your credit cards or drawing down on your
unsecured loans. Give up your unused cards and your credit lines!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pay the debts which incur higher interest first, but look out for penalties</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Where To Get Help</h3>
<p>You can do the following:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Contact <a href="http://www.ccs.org.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Credit Counselling Singapore</a> for
help to resolve your debt problems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Apply for a <a href="https://www.abs.org.sg/consumer-banking/consumers/debt-consolidation-plan" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Debt Consolidation Plan</a>,
if you have unsecured debts exceeding 12 times your monthly income. Your
debts from different banks will be consolidated with one of the participating
banks at a lower interest rate.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Debt Consolidation Plan (DCP)</h3>
<p>If you're heavily in debt, a <a href="https://www.abs.org.sg/consumer-banking/consumers/debt-consolidation-plan" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Debt Consolidation Plan (DCP)</a> could
help you turn things around. DCP is an industry-initiated debt-refinancing
programme.</p>
<h4>How It Works</h4>
<p>With this plan:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Your outstanding unsecured debts from different FIs are moved to one FI</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The interest rate will be lower. You're committed to making fixed monthly
repayments until you repay all outstanding balances</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Except for education, medical or business loans, you can't use your existing
unsecured credit facilities or get new ones anymore. Instead, you'll receive
a concessionary revolving unsecured credit facility in the form of a credit
card. It comes with a credit limit of 1 month's income for your daily needs</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Who Can Apply For DCP?</h4>
<p>You can apply for DCP if you meet these criteria:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>You're a Singaporean or Permanent Resident</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Earn a salary between $20,000 and $120,000 a year</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have net personal assets of less than $2 million</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have unsecured debts exceeding 12 times your monthly income</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Do note that after you close the DCP account, the last 12 months' payment
status history will be displayed in your credit report for three years.</p>
