<h3>Avoiding The Debt Trap</h3>
<p>Here are some ways you can tweak your habits to avoid or reduce debt.</p>
<p>When paying your bills or loans:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Pay off high-interest loans and credit facilities first</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use GIRO to automatically pay your bills, so you don't forget to make
payments</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avoid credit card fees and charges by paying your bills in full before
the due date</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When spending money:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Save up for big ticket items instead of <a href="https://www.moneysense.gov.sg/buy-now-pay-later/real-cost-instalment-payment-plan/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">buying on instalment</a>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don't shop on impulse; compare prices before buying</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use cash or a debit card to shop</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avoid people who pressure you to spend</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Paying Off Your Debts</h3>
<p>If you're having problems with your cash flow, you can take steps to better
manage your debt:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Draw up a budget –</strong> List out your monthly income and family
expenses, and see what expenses you can trim to repay your debts faster.
Cut out indulgences like eating out or going to the movies if you have
trouble paying your bills.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Review your debts–</strong> Avoid having many sources of credit.
It is easier to keep track of repayments when you have fewer credit facilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Pay on time –</strong> Make your repayments on time to avoid interest
and late charges. If you have difficulty making the repayments, talk to
your bank.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Pay more if you can –</strong> Increase your regular repayments
or make lump sum payments when you have money to spare. It will help you
pay off your debt sooner. Check if there are penalty charges or if you
need to give your bank advance notice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Pay off the debt with the highest interest first –</strong> If
you have credit card debt, other unsecured loans or instalment plans, follow
these steps to pay them off as quickly as possible. Repeat until your debts
are paid off:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Order your outstanding loans by interest rates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pay off the full amount with the highest interest rate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you have trouble paying the full amount, pay it off in parts. Save
and pay till it's paid off.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Go back to Step 1 and start over. Keep going till you pay off all your
loans.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>What If You Can't Pay?</h3>
<p>Speak to your bank immediately. They may be able to help you restructure
your payments.</p>
<p>If you can't keep up with repayments:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Your credit score will be affected. Your credit score forms part of your
credit report which is used by banks to decide whether to lend you money.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Late payments may lower your chances of getting a loan in the future,
or require you to pay a higher interest rate for a loan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The bank will take increasingly severe measures if you ignore them.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Work With Your Bank</h3>
<p>Do not avoid calls or letters from your bank, its lawyers or debt collectors.
Talk to them as soon as possible. Remain co-operative and contactable.
If you are co-operative, your bank is more likely to help you restructure
your payment schedule.</p>
<h3>If You Have Multiple Debts</h3>
<p>Don't give up – you can improve your debt situation. Here are steps you
can take:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Get a credit report and assess the total amount of debt you owe</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Talk to your financial institution. See if you can convert your outstanding
credit and unsecured loans into a debt repayment plan, where you can repay
your debt by instalments</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not borrow from other sources to pay off your debts without first comparing
the interest charges and fees</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Refrain from charging more to your credit cards or drawing down on your
unsecured loans. Give up your cards and your credit lines!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pay the debts which incur higher interest first, but look out for penalties</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Where To Get Help</h3>
<p>You can do the following:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Contact <a href="http://www.ccs.org.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Credit Counselling Singapore</a> for
help to resolve your debt problems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Apply for a <a href="https://www.abs.org.sg/consumer-banking/consumers/debt-consolidation-plan" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Debt Consolidation Plan</a>,
if you have unsecured debts exceeding 12 times your monthly income. Your
debts from different banks will be consolidated with one of the participating
banks at a lower interest rate.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Debt Consolidation Plan (DCP)</h3>
<p>If you're heavily in debt, a <a href="https://www.abs.org.sg/consumer-banking/consumers/debt-consolidation-plan" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Debt Consolidation Plan (DCP)</a> could
help you turn things around. DCP is an industry-initiated debt-refinancing
programme. It will help you clear your debt if you have unsecured debts
of more than 12 times your monthly income.</p>
<h4>How It Works</h4>
<p>With this plan:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Your outstanding unsecured debts from different banks are moved to one
bank.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The interest rate will be lower. You're committed to making fixed monthly
repayments until you repay all outstanding balances.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Except for education, medical or business loans, you can't use your existing
unsecured credit facilities or get new ones anymore. Instead, you'll receive
a concessionary revolving unsecured credit facility in the form of a credit
card. It comes with a credit limit of 1 month's income for your daily needs.</p>
</li>
</ul>
