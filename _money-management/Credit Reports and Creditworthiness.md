<h3>What Is A Credit Bureau?</h3>
<p>A credit bureau is an agency that collects and stores information on your
credit history, such as loans, credit card applications and repayment records.</p>
<p>Information in the credit report is provided by members of the credit
bureau such as banks and credit card companies, and obtained from public
sources on bankruptcy.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.creditbureau.com.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Credit Bureau (Singapore)</a> is
licensed and regulated by the Monetary Authority of Singapore under the
Credit Bureau Act 2016.</p>
<h3>What Is A Credit Report?</h3>
<p>A credit report is a compilation of your credit payment history collected
across banks and major financial institutions. It is issued by a credit
bureau to lenders, e.g., banks, finance companies, and credit card companies
when they perform creditworthiness checks on you. You may also request
a copy of your report from the bureaus.</p>
<h3>Why It Matters</h3>
<p>Banks and other financial institutions will assess your creditworthiness
by looking at the credit score, alongside other considerations such as
income. The score is one of the factors that helps them make better lending
decisions when you apply for credit facilities such as loans and credit
cards.</p>
<p>A good credit repayment history makes it easier for you to qualify for
loans and credit cards in the future.</p>
<h3>Factors That Affect Your Credit Score</h3>
<p>A number of different factors could affect your credit score:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Utilisation Pattern – </strong>the amount of credit owned/ used
on accounts by individuals</p>
<p><strong>• Available Credit – </strong>the number of accounts open or active
that provide you with a credit facility</p>
<p><strong>• Account Delinquency Data – </strong>Late payment on your loan
accounts</p>
<p><strong>• Credit Account History – </strong>A consumer with long-established
credit history is deemed to be more favourable or a reliable borrower as
compared to one with limited or no credit history. Accounts with history
of prompt payments will help to boost your credit rating</p>
<p><strong>• Enquiry Activity – </strong>While self-enquiries will not have
an effect on your credit score, increased loan application activities have
a direct correlation to credit risk and indicate that the consumer’s debt
exposure is likely to increase. To keep your enquiries to a minimum, try
to limit the number of loan facilities and credit cards that you apply
for</p>
<p><strong>• Recent Credit – </strong>If you have recently taken multiple
new credit facilities within a short period, it may be perceived as you
overextending yourself</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>If You Disagree With Your Report</h3>
<p>If you spot an error or disagree with any information in your credit report,
write to the credit bureau. The credit bureau will:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Forward your request to the member who contributed the data after authentication
or verification is completed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Post a notice in your credit report that the data is being disputed and
is under investigation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inform you of the outcome of the investigation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Send the revised report to all its members who made enquiries on you in
the past 12 months</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Tips On Rebuilding Your Credit Score</h3>
<p>Building back your credit score takes time and steady effort – there are
no shortcuts. A positive repayment track record and responsible use of
credit over time are essential.</p>
<p>To improve your credit score:</p>
<p>• Strive to pay your bills in full and on time, and stay within your spending
limits</p>
<p>• Limit the number of your credit accounts to help you stay on top of
payments and avoid extra charges like annual fees</p>
<p>• Avoid taking multiple loans within a short time frame</p>
<p>• Pay down debts as much as possible</p>
<p>• Simplify payments and prevent missed bills by setting up automatic debits
using GIRO or standing instructions</p>
<p>• If you are unable to obtain an unsecured credit card, consider applying
for a secured credit card instead. Prompt payment of bills whilst minimising
debt accumulation can help to improve your credit score and contribute
towards improving your credit account history</p>
<p>• Check your credit report regularly to proactively identify and address
issues that may negatively affect your credit reputation. Information in
the credit report can help you assess your financial situation, identify
steps to better manage credit and improve your credit history over time</p>
