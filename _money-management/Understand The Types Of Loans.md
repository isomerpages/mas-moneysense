<li>
<p>If the value of the collateral falls below the loan amount, the borrower
may have to top up with more assets or pay down some of the outstanding
loan amount</p>

<p>If the loan is not repaid, assets can be repossessed and sold to recover
the loan</p>

<h3>Term versus revolving loans</h3>
<p>With a <strong>term loan,</strong> you must repay the loan by instalments
over the loan period. The bank can recall the loan if you breach the terms
of the loan agreement. The loan is usually larger in amount and has a longer
repayment period.</p>
<p>Examples: housing loans, car loans and education loans.</p>
<p><strong>Revolving loans</strong> allow you to use the money up to an agreed
credit limit whenever you need it. Once you repay the amount owed, the
credit becomes available to draw on again.</p>
<p>Examples: bank overdrafts, personal lines of credit and credit cards.</p>
