<p><strong>A debit card lets you draw directly from your bank account when you make a purchase. Find out how it works, what to watch out for and how it compares to ATM and credit cards.</strong>
</p>
<h3><strong>Key Takeaways</strong></h3>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>You can use a debit card to withdraw money from an ATM.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can also use it like a credit card for Point-of-Sale (POS) transactions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unlike credit cards, the amount is immediately deducted from your bank
account, so you cannot spend more than what you have in your account.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>What Is A Debit Card?</strong></h3>
<p>Debit cards are like ATM cards. You can use it to buy goods and services.
You can also use your debit card with your Personal Identification Number
(PIN) to withdraw cash from your bank account at your bankâ€™s ATMs.</p>
<h3><strong>How It Works</strong></h3>
<p>When you shop with your debit card or ATM card, the transaction amount
is immediately deducted from your bank account. You cannot spend more than
what's in your account.</p>
<p>Unlike ATM cards, debit cards have a VISA or MasterCard branding. More
often, you may not need to sign the receipt for purchases below a certain
amount at some merchants.</p>
<p>While this may seem similar to credit cards, do note that when you use
credit cards, you are paying on credit. When you use a debit card, the
purchase amount is drawn from your own bank account.</p>
<p>Fees may be charged for debit cards. There may be an annual fee, a replacement
fee for lost cards and a fee for withdrawals made abroad.</p>

<h3><strong>Risks And Safeguards</strong></h3>
<p>Although banks in Singapore have replaced magnetic stripe-only debit cards
with chip cards, magnetic stripes are still used overseas.</p>
<p>Here are a few ways to protect yourself:</p>
<h4><strong>Activate Transaction Alerts</strong></h4>
<p>Chip technology can reduce the risks of cloning but the magnetic stripe
part on your debit card can still be cloned or skimmed. Make sure you have
activated transaction alerts.</p>
<h4><strong>Check If The Correct Amount Is Debited</strong></h4>
<p>Some small-value purchases do not need a signature. Ask for a receipt
to check if the correct amount is deducted. If the amount is wrong, alert
the merchant immediately to ask for a refund. If you are not at POS, contact
your bank quickly to see if it can help to reverse the transaction.</p>
<h4><strong>Be Careful When Transacting Online</strong></h4>
<p>Your debit card details may be captured by intercepting your online transactions.
Criminals will then use the details to perform card-not-present transactions
such as online or mail-order/ telephone-order transactions.</p>
<h4><strong>Shop On 3D Secure Websites</strong></h4>
<p>A One-Time Password (OTP) is needed before completing the purchase. This
step ensures that the person making the purchase is the rightful owner
of the debit card used. Notify your bank immediately if you received an
OTP but did not make the transaction.</p>
<h3><strong>Lost Or Stolen Cards</strong></h3>
<p>If you lose your debit card, let the card issuer know immediately. If
it is stolen, make a police report and inform the card issuer. The maximum
liability for unauthorised charges before reporting the loss to the card
issuer will be capped at $100.</p>
<p>This cap applies provided you have not acted fraudulently, or you were
not grossly negligent or did not fail to inform the card issuer as soon
as you became aware that the card was lost or stolen.</p>
<p>Do check with your bank on its policy for lost or stolen debit cards.</p>
