<h3><strong>What Is A Credit Card?</strong></h3>
<p>A credit card is a form of borrowing and allows you to borrow up to the
credit limit set for your card. Whatever you charge to your credit card
is called the outstanding or unpaid balance. It represents what you owe.</p>
<p>You can pay your outstanding monthly balance in full, make a partial payment
or pay the minimum sum. However, a high interest charge (25% to 29% per
annum) will apply on the balance and any new transactions charged.</p>
<h3><strong>Key Features</strong></h3>
<p>The key features of credit cards include the following:</p>
<p><strong>Annual Fees</strong>
</p>
<p>This is a membership fee which you have to pay for the use of the credit
card.</p>
<p><strong>Monthly Statement</strong>
</p>
<p>Your bank will send you a monthly statement (i.e. bill) with details of
your credit card spending for the month. Check your statement carefully
to keep track of how much you had spent. Let your bank know if there are
transactions which you do not recognise or if anything is unclear.</p>
<p>The <strong>payment due date</strong> is the date by which the bank must
receive the money to pay your credit card bill in full, to avoid incurring
interest and late charges.</p>

</p>
<p><strong>Foreign Currency Transactions</strong>
</p>
<p>Overseas purchases will be converted to Singapore dollars in your statement.
The foreign exchange rates used may vary from day to day and from bank
to bank. They usually include currency conversion charges or other administrative
fees. Check with your bank for their rates.</p>
<p><strong>Free Credit Period Before The Due Date</strong>
</p>
<p>When you receive your credit card bill each month, you are given 20 to
25 days to pay it (by the due date) before the bank starts charging interest
and late fees. This period is known as the free credit period.</p>
<p><strong>Minimum Sum For Payments</strong>
</p>
<p>Paying the minimum sum due on your credit card means the rest of your
balance will incur interest charges. The minimum sum is usually 3% to 5%
of the unpaid balance or a specified amount, e.g. $50, whichever is higher.</p>
<h3><strong>Note</strong></h3>
<p>If you are really unable to pay your bill in full, pay at least the minimum
sum by the due date to avoid late payment charges. Then <strong>pay off the balance as quickly as possible.</strong> Put
your credit card away until you have paid off the outstanding balance.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><strong>Interest Charge On Unpaid Balances</strong></h3>
<p>If you make a partial payment or only pay the minimum sum due, <strong>interest will be charged</strong> on
the unpaid balance. Interest will also be payable on any new purchases.</p>
<h3><strong>Note</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.moneysense.gov.sg/understanding-credit-card-interest-and-charges/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Credit card interest</a> can
easily snowball. Use your credit card only when you can afford to pay for
the purchases.</p>
<h3><strong>Gifts And Rewards</strong></h3>
<p>You may get gifts, cashback and bonus points when you chalk up your credit
card spending. Compare how bonus points are calculated as different banks
have different reward schemes. Specific terms and conditions may apply.
For example, you may not be able to cancel your card within the first year
after claiming a gift.</p>
<h3><strong>Credit Card Instalment Plans</strong></h3>
<p>When you buy something on a <a href="https://team.dms.mas.gov.sg/sites/csi/consEdn/MoneySense%20Website/MS%202023%20Website%20Archive/Offline%20Website/MON-241-PRD/www.moneysense.gov.sg/articles/2018/11/the-real-cost-of-instalment-payment-plans.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">credit card instalment plan</a>,
you have to settle it in full. Which means that even if the merchant fails,
you have to keep paying the monthly instalment until it is fully settled.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>In-house Instalment Payment Plan:</strong> The store offers to
extend credit to the customer. In these plans, the store can usually repossess
the item should the customer fail to pay their instalments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Instalment Payment Plan:</strong> Credit is offered as a deal between
a credit card issuer and a merchant as an incentive for customers to use
that credit card.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Applying For A Credit Card</strong></h3>
<p>You can apply for a credit card from any credit card issuer or bank. If
your application is accepted, you will receive a card with a fixed credit
limit.</p>
<p>Before that, the credit card issuer or bank will assess your income and
repayment ability by reviewing your credit report. Take a look at your
<a href="https://team.dms.mas.gov.sg/sites/csi/consEdn/MoneySense%20Website/MS%202023%20Website%20Archive/Offline%20Website/MON-241-PRD/www.moneysense.gov.sg/articles/2018/11/credit-reports-and-creditworthiness.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">credit report</a>to see if it is accurate.</p>
<p>You will also sometimes see credit cards offered at roadshows and shopping
malls. While the credit card promoter can help you fill out the form, the
final decision to send in the application rests with you.</p>
<h3><strong>Eligibility And Credit Limit</strong></h3>
<p>To apply for a credit card, you must meet the bank's eligibility requirements,
including a minimum annual income of $30,000.</p>
<p>While you may meet the eligibility criteria, you will also be subjected
to the rules on unsecured credit limits from the Monetary Authority of
Singapore.</p>
<p><strong>Tips:</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Do not apply for more cards than you need, even if they are free. Limit
the number of credit cards to your needs and repayment ability, and cancel
cards that you do not use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A <strong>debit card</strong> limits your spending to what you have in your
bank account. If you are not confident that you can control your spending,
it is a good alternative to a credit card.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>If You Lose Your Credit Card Or Suspect Fraud</strong></h3>
<p>Call the bank immediately if your credit card is lost or stolen, or if
there are unauthorised transactions. Note the time and date when you do
so.</p>
<p>Set SMS alerts on your credit card transactions to notify you if your
card is charged above a certain amount or used overseas.</p>
