Knowing where our money goes helps us manage our cashflow better. Find out how to keep track of your income and expenses, and when to cut back on your spending.

**Key takeaways**

*   Before you take on more liabilities, you need to ensure you have enough resources to meet them.
*   Think hard about what you really need and can afford before you commit.
*   Review your spending and make a concrete plan to cut back if you need to.

Do you spend more than you earn? Before you start managing your money, take a closer look at your current cashflow.

You need a clear understanding of where your money is going, to assess the health of your finances.

### Tip

Take the [Financial Health Check](https://www.moneysense.gov.sg/financial-health-check) and find out whether you're in good financial shape. You'll also get a customised plan with steps you can take.

### Keeping track of your income and expenses

Take these steps to have a better idea of where your money goes:

**1\. List down all the income sources**

Make a note of:

*   Your salary
*   Interest earned from savings
*   Income from investments, such as dividends and coupon payments

**2\. Make a second list of your expenses**

Write down:

*   Your household and personal expenses
*   Loan repayments (e.g. housing loans, car loans)
*   Credit card bills
*   Health and life insurance premiums
*   Taxes, etc.

**3\. Add up the expenses**

How much of your income is left over after your expenses? Use our [Budget Calculator](https://www.moneysense.gov.sg/financial-tools/budget-calculator) to help you. If your income is not enough to cover your expenses, examine your spending habits to see if you need to cut back.

Now that we have a good idea of what we spend our money on, let's take a look at how we can manage our money to meet our needs and goals.
