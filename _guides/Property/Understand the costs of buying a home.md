Buying a home needs careful planning. Find out what you have to pay upfront and on a monthly basis, and why you should be insured.

**Key takeaways**

*   Be prepared for one-time downpayment and recurring costs.
*   Find out what you can afford before deciding to buy.

### What do you have to pay?

Buying a home is a big financial commitment that needs careful planning.

The home that you buy should meet you and your family's needs now and in the future. With this in mind, take a moment to think about what's important and what's nice to have.

Before looking for a home to buy:

*   [Do your sums](/guides/taking-stock-of-your-finances)&nbsp;and look at what you can afford
*   Find out what your&nbsp;[mortgage payments](/financial-tools/mortgage-calculator)&nbsp;will look like

What you can afford depends on your income, expenses, debts and savings as well as the amount you may be eligible to borrow. You'll need to make some upfront payments, and keep up with monthly housing loan instalments, and other recurring charges.

### Upfront payments

The payments you need to make to purchase your home include:

*   Option fee
*   Downpayment
*   [Buyer's stamp duty](https://www.iras.gov.sg/irashome/other-taxes/stamp-duty-for-property/working-out-your-stamp-duty/buying-or-acquiring-property/what-is-the-duty-that-i-need-to-pay-as-a-buyer-or-transferee-of-residential-property/buyer-s-stamp-duty--bsd-/)
*   [Additional Buyer's Stamp Duty](https://www.iras.gov.sg/IRASHome/Other-Taxes/Stamp-Duty-for-Property/Working-out-your-Stamp-Duty/Buying-or-Acquiring-Property/What-is-the-Duty-that-I-Need-to-Pay-as-a-Buyer-or-Transferee-of-Residential-Property/Additional-Buyer-s-Stamp-Duty--ABSD-/)&nbsp;(for a second and subsequent property if you're a Singapore Citizen)
*   Legal costs, including stamp fees
*   [Agent's commission](https://www.cea.gov.sg/docs/default-source/module/newsletter/jan-feb-2016/201601-new/commissions-five-things-to-know.html)&nbsp;and fees
*   Other miscellaneous costs

Let's look at a few of these in detail.

### Option fee

### Downpayment

How much downpayment you have to pay in cash or from your CPF savings depends on:

*   The value and type of property.
*   Whether you have an existing housing loan and the tenure of the new loan (capped at 25 years for HDB flats and 30 years for private properties).
*   The loan-to-value (LTV) limit (loan ceiling) of the property.

#### For an HDB loan

| Flat type | Downpayment in cash or CPF |
| --- | --- |
| Build-To-Order Flats (BTO) | 20% of purchase price, includes booking fee and balance (both only in cash and/or CPF). |
| Resale | 20% of purchase price, includes booking fee and balance (both only in cash and/or CPF). |

#### For a bank loan

| Downpayment | No outstanding housing loan | 2nd housing loan | 3rd housing loan |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Minimum cash downpayment | 5% (for LTV of 75%) or 10% (for LTV of 55%) | 25% | 25% |
| Rest of downpayment| Can be paid using cash and/or CPF |

### Third-party costs

| Fees | Paid to | What it's for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Valuation fee | Professional appraiser | Valuation report on the property to be financed. |
| Legal fee | Lawyers | Processing the mortgage over the property to be financed. |
| Stamp duty | Government | A tax payable for registration of the mortgage. |
| Insurance premium | Insurance company | Insurance cover for your property against fire and other damage. Lenders will require you to adequately insure assets being financed. |

### Recurring payments

In addition to your monthly home loan repayments, you'll also want to budget for other recurring costs that come with owning a home. These include:

*   Maintenance, conservancy charges and utilities
*   Property tax
*   Mortgage insurance and other home-related insurance

#### Maintenance, conservancy charges and utilities
HDB homeowners pay monthly&nbsp;[service and conservancy charges](https://www.jrtc.org.sg/our-services/)&nbsp;to their town councils for maintaining their housing estates. You pay a higher fee for a larger flat.

Owners of private properties such as condominiums and apartments typically pay monthly maintenance fees.

Utility charges (power, water and gas) depend on their usage.

#### Property tax

The property tax payable annually is computed based on a percentage of the annual value of the property. The annual value is the estimated annual rent that your property can fetch, regardless of whether you rent it out or not.

Find out more about property tax from the&nbsp;[IRAS website](https://www.iras.gov.sg/IRASHome/Property/Property-owners/).

You pay lower property tax if you live in the property you own, compared to if you rent out your property.

#### Mortgage insurance

##### For HDB flats

If you're buying an HDB flat and using your CPF savings to pay your monthly instalments, you must be insured under the [CPFâ€™s Home Protection Scheme](https://www.cpf.gov.sg/member/faq/home-ownership/home-protection-scheme).

This insurance scheme protects you and your family against losing your home should you become permanently disabled, or pass away before the housing loan is paid up.

Even if you're not using your CPF monies to pay for your monthly instalments, you're still encouraged to be insured under the Home Protection Scheme. You can use your CPF monies to pay for this.

##### For private properties

A **mortgage reducing term insurance** protects your dependants if you (the borrower) should pass away or become permanently disabled and can no longer service the loan.

##### All properties
If your property is mortgaged to a bank, you may be required to take up a mortgagee interest policy.

#### Insurance for your home

If your property is mortgaged to a bank, you may be required to take up a mortgagee interest policy.

For peace of mind, it's a good idea to insure your home against fire and other perils. The cost of such insurance is generally low relative to the potential loss.

Some policies, like fire insurance and mortgagee interest policies, may be required by your bank. Here's a comparison of the [different types of home insurance](http://gia.org.sg/consumers/property.html) and what they are for:

#### Fire insurance
