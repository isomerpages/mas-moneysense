Buying a home needs careful planning. Find out what you have to pay upfront and on a monthly basis, and why you should be insured.

**Key takeaways**

*   Be prepared for one-time downpayment and recurring costs.
*   Find out what you can afford before deciding to buy.

### What do you have to pay?

Buying a home is a big financial commitment that needs careful planning.

The home that you buy should meet you and your family's needs now and in the future. With this in mind, take a moment to think about what's important and what's nice to have.

Before looking for a home to buy:

*   [Do your sums](/guides/taking-stock-of-your-finances) and look at what you can afford
*   Find out what your [mortgage payments](/financial-tools/mortgage-calculator) will look like

What you can afford depends on your income, expenses, debts and savings as well as the amount you may be eligible to borrow. You'll need to make some upfront payments, and keep up with monthly housing loan instalments, and other recurring charges.

### Upfront payments

The payments you need to make to purchase your home include:

*   Option fee
*   Downpayment
*   [Buyer's stamp duty](https://www.iras.gov.sg/irashome/other-taxes/stamp-duty-for-property/working-out-your-stamp-duty/buying-or-acquiring-property/what-is-the-duty-that-i-need-to-pay-as-a-buyer-or-transferee-of-residential-property/buyer-s-stamp-duty--bsd-/)
