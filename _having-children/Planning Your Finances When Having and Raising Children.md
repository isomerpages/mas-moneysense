<p><strong>Starting a family requires planning. With a clear idea of what it involves and the schemes available to ease new parents' financial load, you will be ready to embrace one of life's greatest joys.</strong>
</p>
<p>You will never hear a parent lamenting, "I wish I didn't have any children.
It's so expensive!" Yet, it is not uncommon for the financial responsibilities
of raising a child to be one of the main sources of trepidation for those
mulling to start a family.</p>
<p>Concerns over the cost of having a child should not stop you and your
spouse from experiencing one of the greatest joys in life. Yes, you will
need to set aside extra savings when a tot (or a few) joins you, but it
is all doable with planning and the discipline to make sound financial
decisions.</p>
<p>Before you start a family, you and your spouse should:</p>
<h4>Plan and Prioritise</h4>
<hr>
<p>Review your financial situation and financial plans. Draw up a fresh budget
for the household to prioritise your spending so as to accommodate new
expenses for your baby — doctor's visits for mummy and baby, baby's daily
necessities and perhaps even fun activities for your little one, etc. Revise
your financial plan to cater for your child's longer term needs such as
tertiary education.</p>
<h4>Do Your Research</h4>
<hr>
<p>Talk to professionals, your friends and family members to have an idea
of what it would cost to pay for your child's needs. Don't let the information
alarm you but see it as a way to help you prepare for what's to come.</p>
<p>You should also read up the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.moh.gov.sg/cost-financing/healthcare-schemes-subsidies/marriage-and-parenthood-schemes" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">various government help schemes</a>&nbsp;available,
including the Enhanced Baby Bonus, Enhanced MediSave Grant for Newborns
and subsidies for centre-based infant and child care.</p>
<p>If need be, you can also use your MediSave to pay for:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Pre-delivery expenses such as pre-natal consultations, ultrasound scans,
tests and medications, as well as delivery expenses. The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.madeforfamilies.gov.sg/marriage/getting-baby-ready/medisave-maternity-package" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">MediSave maternity package</a>&nbsp;covers
these expenses — up to withdrawal limits — for all your children, incurred
at both public and private healthcare institutions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Help with conceiving. MediSave can be used to pay for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.madeforfamilies.gov.sg/marriage/getting-baby-ready/medisave-for-assisted-conception-procedures" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Assisted Conception Procedures.</a>&nbsp;Assisted
Reproduction Technology treatment, such as in-vitro fertilisation (IVF)
and intra-uterine insemination (IUI), is also available at public hospitals
and is co-funded — up to 75 per cent — by the government.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>What To Expect When You Are Expecting</h4>
<hr>
<p>Here are a few things to note when you are expecting:</p>
<h4>Maternity Packages and Consultation Charges</h4>
<p>Consultation and delivery charges vary. You may want to consider pre-natal
packages offered by some gynaecologists that cover regular consultancy
charges and basic medication. Read the details of the maternity packages
carefully to find out what is not included.</p>
<h4>Delivery Charges</h4>
<p>The cost of delivery packages also varies depending on the type of delivery,
choice of hospital and the length of stay. Broadly, delivery by C-section
costs more; and private hospital stays are more expensive.</p>

</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Do You Already Have Maternity Benefits?</h4>
<p>If you have a health insurance policy, find out if it covers pre- and
post- delivery visits to the doctor. Some health insurance plans include
extended maternity benefits. The benefits may include delivery, complications
and neonatal cover.</p>
<p>Remember to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Find out what is the waiting period before such benefits kick-in</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Weigh the benefits versus the excess cost you need to bear</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make sure you understand the policy exclusions, if any</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Read the terms and conditions carefully</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Buy Life Insurance</h4>
<p>Newborns who are registered as Singapore Citizens at birth are automatically
insured under MediShield Life.&nbsp;Think about life insurance to help
provide for your family should something unexpected happen to you.</p>
<h4>Paying For Your Child’s Changing Needs</h4>
<hr>
<p>Having a child changes your world. You may need to cut back on your personal
expenses and set aside more money for your child’s needs as she or he grows.</p>
<h4>From Birth to 18 Months</h4>
<p>You will need to pay for your baby’s basic needs such as:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Milk, nappies and food</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A place to sleep, e.g. cot or mattress</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clothing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Healthcare</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Tip</h4>
<p><strong><em>Start saving up during the pregnancy to buy these items.</em></strong>
</p>
<p>Later on, you may need to buy other items such as a baby stroller and
car seat. What it costs will depend on whether you buy new or branded items,
or make use of hand-me-downs. On top of these, you may need infant care
or nanny care.</p>
<p>Some tips to help you manage costs at this age:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Plan a budget.</strong>&nbsp;Cut down some expenses by asking
your family and friends for hand-me-downs. Children grow quickly! So, items
like clothes, toys, car seats and bathtubs are rarely worn out.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Identify needs and wants.</strong>&nbsp;Even if you wish to give
your children the best, remember that they outgrow items like clothes and
shoes pretty quickly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Get help with childcare</strong>. Involve grandparents or other
family members in childcare.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Find out about any&nbsp;<strong>government help</strong>&nbsp;you can
get.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>From Toddler to Teens</h4>
<p>University may seem far away when your children are toddlers. But it is
never too early to start saving for their school fees and university education.
The earlier you begin, the more time you have for your money to compound
and grow.</p>
<p>Some tips to help you manage costs at this age:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Start saving up now</strong>. The sooner, the more, the better.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Readjust your budget</strong>. Include the costs of bringing up
your teen. A budget will help you manage your household income and expenses
as you save.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Update your own financial plan</strong>. This will help you work
towards goals like paying for your child’s university education.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Buy health insurance for your children</strong>&nbsp;if you want
more than what MediShield Life provides.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Staying at Home?</h4>
<p>If you or your spouse decides to stop work or to work part-time, you will
need to adjust your budget to deal with the loss of income.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Cut back on your spending patterns and make some lifestyle changes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maintain your life insurance policy for protection purposes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add on more cover if you have another child. But make sure you can afford
the extra premiums first.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Be careful not to cut back on your savings for retirement or healthcare
insurance. You need to take care of yourself as well.</p>

<h4>Paying for University</h4>
<hr>
<p>Saving for a child's university education should be one of your priorities
as a parent. The cost can be hefty. Apart from school or tuition fees,
you have to factor in living expenses if you are planning to send your
child overseas. The cost can be daunting if you do not prepare or plan
ahead.</p>
