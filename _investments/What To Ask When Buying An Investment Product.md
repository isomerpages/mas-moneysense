<h3>10 Questions To Ask Yourself</h3>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Is the FA representative regulated by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS)?<br></strong>Check
the <a href="https://eservices.mas.gov.sg/fid" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">MAS Financial Institutions Directory</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>What are my investment goals?<br></strong>Am I looking to protect
or grow my savings? How much do I need and when do I need this?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>How much can I afford to invest?<br></strong>Do I have enough
after setting aside money for my daily needs and for emergencies?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>What is my appetite for risk?</strong> 
<br>How much can I afford to lose without overly impacting my financial situation
and my financial plans?</p>
<h3>Tip</h3>
<p>Understand yourself better with the <a href="https://www.cpf.gov.sg/content/dam/web/member/growing-your-savings/documents/Risk_Tolerance_Questionaire.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Risk Tolerance Questionnaire</a>.</p>

<li>
<p><strong>Does the recommended product meet my needs?</strong>
</p>
<p>Which benefits are guaranteed and which are not?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>What is the potential return?</strong>
</p>
<p>Is it realistic? What is the maximum I could lose?
<br>Be careful of verbal promises and guarantees of high returns. Insist on
written confirmation of any guaranteed returns or benefits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Should I invest with my CPF savings?</strong>
</p>
<p>If so, how does the return offered by the product compare with interest
rates earned in my CPF accounts?</p>
<h3>Tip</h3>
<p>Money in your CPF Ordinary Account and Special Account currently earn
a minimum interest of 2.5% and 4% per annum, respectively. This is both
guaranteed and risk-free.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>When does the investment pay out?</strong> 
<br>Can I afford to stay invested for that duration? Do I need the money earlier?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Have I read all the documents?</strong> 
<br>Do I understand the prospectus, product summary or product highlight sheet,
contracts, warnings, exclusions and disclaimers, and terms and conditions?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Are there other products that offer similar benefits and risks?</strong>
</p>
<p>How does the product compare with these alternative products?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>10 Questions To Ask Your FA Representative</h3>

<p><strong>Why is this product suitable for me?</strong>

or structured deposit? Is it primarily for savings, investment or insurance
protection?</p>

<p><strong>What benefits does this product offer?<br></strong>Which benefits
are guaranteed and which are not? Are there alternative products that offer
similar benefits? How do they compare?</p>

<li>
<p><strong>Ask the FA representative about their risk profiling method</strong>  <strong>and basis for the eventual risk profile.</strong>

<p>Is the product suitable for my risk profile? Is this product low, medium
or high risk?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>How much do I need to commit?</strong> 
<br>Does it require a one-time payment or regular payments? What will happen
if I find that I am unable to make the payment? What are the fees and charges?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the FA representative recommends investing with CPF monies, ask <strong>"How do the returns compare with interest rates earned by monies in your CPF accounts?</strong>"</p>
<h3>Tip</h3>

respectively. This is both guaranteed and risk-free.</p>

some or all of my investments earlier?</p>

<li>
<p><strong>How is my investment monitored?<br></strong>What reports and updates
will I receive? How often will I receive these reports and updates?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>What if I find that the investment product is not suitable after purchasing it?<br></strong>Can
I return the product and get my money back? If so, how soon must I inform
my FA representative of my decision to return the product? Are there any
fees and charges?</p>
</li>
