<h3>What To Ask Before Buying</h3>
<p>Investment products such as shares, bonds, structured deposits, unit trusts
and investment-linked insurance carry risks. Knowing what you are buying
is the best way to navigate the risks. Here are a few things you should
ask before investing in them.</p>
<p>Use this list when you meet your FA representative.</p>
<h3>Ask Yourself</h3>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Is the FA representative regulated by the Monetary Authority of Singapore
(MAS)? Check the <a href="https://eservices.mas.gov.sg/fid" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">MAS Financial Institutions Directory</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are my investment goals? Am I looking to protect or grow my savings?
How much do I need and when do I need this?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How much can I afford to invest? Do I have enough after setting aside
money for my daily needs and for emergencies?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is my appetite for risk? How much can I afford to lose without overly
impacting my financial situation and my financial plans?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Tip: </strong>Understand yourself better with the <a href="https://www.cpf.gov.sg/content/dam/web/member/growing-your-savings/documents/Risk_Tolerance_Questionaire.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Risk Tolerance Questionnaire</a>.</p>
<ol start="5" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Does the recommended product meet my needs? Which benefits are guaranteed
and which are not?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the potential return? Is it realistic? What is the maximum I could
lose?
<br>Be careful of verbal promises and guarantees of high returns. Insist on
written confirmation of any guaranteed returns or benefits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Should I invest with my CPF savings? If so, how does the return offered
by the product compare with interest rates earned in my CPF accounts?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Money in your CPF Ordinary Account and Special Account
currently earn a minimum interest of 2.5% and 4% per annum, respectively.
This is both guaranteed and risk-free.</p>
<ol start="8" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>When does the investment pay out? Can I afford to stay invested for that
duration? Do I need the money earlier?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have I read all the documents? Do I understand the prospectus, product
summary or product highlight sheet, contracts, warnings, exclusions and
disclaimers, and terms and conditions?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are there other products that offer similar benefits and risks? How does
the product compare with these alternative products?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Ask Your FA Representative</h3>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Why is this product suitable for me? What type of product is this? Is
it a life insurance policy, unit trust, or structured deposit? Is it primarily
for savings, investment or insurance protection?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What benefits does this product offer? Which benefits are guaranteed and
which are not? Are there alternative products that offer similar benefits?
How do they compare?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What instruments does the product invest in? How risky are these underlying
instruments</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is your risk profiling method and basis for the eventual risk profile?
Is the product suitable for my risk profile? Is this product low, medium
or high risk?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How much do I need to commit? Does it require a one-time payment or regular
payments? What will happen if I find that I am unable to make the payment?
What are the fees and charges?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the FA representative recommends investing with CPF monies, ask "How
do the returns compare with interest rates earned by monies in your CPF
accounts?"</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Tip: </strong>CPF monies currently earn a minimum interest of
2.5% and 4% per annum, respectively. This is both guaranteed and risk-free.</p>
<ol start="7" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>How long must I stay invested? What are the fees and charges? What are
the penalties if I decide to liquidate some or all of my investments earlier?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are you regulated by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS)? Check
if he/ she is listed on the <a href="https://eservices.mas.gov.sg/rr" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">MAS Register of Representatives</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How is my investment monitored? What reports and updates will I receive?
How often will I receive these reports and updates?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What if I find that the investment product is not suitable after purchasing
it? Can I return the product and get my money back? If so, how soon must
I inform my FA representative of my decision to return the product? Are
there any fees and charges?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Tip: </strong>By all means, ask more questions if you are still
unsure about the product your FA representative is recommending.</p>
