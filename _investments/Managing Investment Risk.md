<h3>Know Your Risk Appetite</h3>
<p>Can you afford to lose all of your investment?</p>
<p>Every investment bears risk. In some cases, you could lose some or all
of the money you invested. In other cases, you may have to bear market
price fluctuations. Then, there are cases where you lose income or return
on investment.</p>
<p>Your willingness to accept risk should take into account:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Your current and future commitments. If you have immediate needs, you
should invest in liquid and low-risk assets such as Singapore Savings Bonds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your investment horizon. The longer your investment horizon, the more
time you have to ride out market fluctuations and grow your investment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How much investment capital you can afford to lose. If your investment
suffers a loss, consider how it will impact your commitments such as loan
repayments and your future goals.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As all investments carry risk, you should consider the risk-return tradeoff
before deciding on an investment. Generally, the higher the potential returns,
the greater the risk.</p>
<p><strong>Note: Your risk appetite is more about how much you can afford to lose rather than how much you want to make.</strong>
</p>
<h3>Risk-return Trade-off</h3>
<p>The higher the potential returns, the higher the risks.</p>
<p>For example, if you were to invest in futures, you might expect high returns.
However, at the same time, you need to be prepared for the high level of
risk involved. The question to ask yourself is, “Can I afford to lose a
significant amount, or even all of my money?”</p>
<h3>Managing Risk</h3>
<p>All investments involve some measure of risk. You can use these three
investment strategies to help you manage risk:</p>
<h4>Diversification</h4>
<p>Diversification refers to spreading your investments over a variety of
assets with the aim that a portfolio of lowly-correlated assets does not
all move in the same direction at the same time or even if they do move
in the same direction, it should at least be by different degrees.</p>
<p>You may give up some gains, but the overall risk of loss is reduced and
you will be in a better position to withstand ups and downs in the market.</p>
<p>For example: If you invest in just a single company's shares, you may
lose all your money if the company goes bankrupt.</p>
<p>However, by distributing your investments over five companies, you risk
losing only 20% of your money if one company goes bankrupt.</p>
<p>You can diversify your portfolio by:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Investing in different asset classes (e.g. shares and bonds)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Within each asset class, invest in different securities, industries or
countries (e.g. a portfolio of different shares or exchange-traded fund
that tracks an index)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Correlation</h4>
<p>Assets that move together in the same direction are said to be correlated.
One way to diversify is to combine assets which move randomly or in opposite
ways. These assets can be described as being negatively correlated, or
even not correlated at all.</p>
<p>Investing in assets that are not correlated is beneficial because they
are not impacted by the same market trends. Hence, shocks in one market
will not affect the others.</p>
<p>For example: If the construction industry suffers a downturn, both the
share price of a construction company and the price of steel, which is
used in construction, will drop. These two are positively correlated.</p>
<p>However, industries dealing in healthcare will not be affected and hence
the share price of a healthcare company will move independently or randomly
– they are not correlated.</p>
<h4>Asset Allocation</h4>
<p>Deciding how to distribute your investments is part of the asset allocation
strategy. Here are five factors to consider before you decide on your asset
allocation:</p>
<p><strong>Your investment objectives</strong> – Do you want to preserve your
capital, grow it, get a regular income or have liquidity? For example,
if capital preservation is your key goal, you should allocate more funds
in your portfolio to conservative choices with less risk attached (E.g.
Singapore Savings Bond).</p>
<p><strong>Your investment horizon</strong> – Which life stage are you at,
and what are you saving for? Each goal has its definite investment horizon.
Generally, the younger you are, the longer your investment horizon.</p>
<p><strong>Your risk profile</strong> – Knowing your risk tolerance allows
you to invest comfortably without potentially losing more than you can
afford to. If you have a low tolerance, you should allocate more funds
to lower-risk assets, though you should also expect lower returns.</p>
<p><strong>Asset mix</strong> – Knowing how various assets are correlated
and what risks and returns to expect from each will help you decide on
your preferred asset mix.</p>
<p><strong>Current and expected market conditions</strong> – Have your personal
circumstances changed? Even if your situation has not shifted, the markets
are likely to have. It is important to monitor and re-balance your asset
mix regularly in order to maintain a balanced portfolio.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that your investment objective, horizon and risk profile
are likely to change as you go through different life stages. You will
want to re-evaluate these from time to time.</p>
<h4>Dollar-cost Averaging</h4>
<p>Market conditions are hard to predict. Trying to buy low and sell high
can be challenging and most investors fail to sustain any significant returns
this way.</p>
<p>A more disciplined approach is dollar-cost averaging. With this approach,
you invest a fixed sum of money at regular intervals, whether the market
is up or down.</p>
<p>For example, if you invest $1,000 every month, you buy more shares when
the market is down and fewer shares when the market is up.</p>
<p>Over a long investment horizon, it would result in a lower average cost
per share.</p>
