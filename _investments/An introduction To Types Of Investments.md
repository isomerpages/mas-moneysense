<h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Investment products have different features and risk characteristics</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For more complex products, you will be required to undergo a knowledge
assessment or account review before they can be sold to you</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>An important aspect of investing is understanding the product before you
put your money in it.</p>
<p>You might ask:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>What are the productâ€™s benefits, risks, limitations and transaction costs?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the maximum you can lose in a worst case scenario and how might
this happen?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Will this product complement, supplement or replace your existing investments?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Will you become over-exposed to a particular risk if your portfolio is
not sufficiently diversified?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>A Brief Introduction To Financial Markets</h3>
<p>The primary market is where new issues of financial assets are sold. Examples
are Initial Public Offers (IPOs) for ordinary shares and tenders for government
bonds.</p>
<p>The secondary market is where an investor can purchase an asset from another
investor rather than the issuer. The Singapore Exchange (SGX) is an example
of such a stock market, or stock exchange.</p>
<p>Different asset classes such as shares, Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) and
Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITS) are listed on the exchange. There
are fixed trading hours during which the prices of the shares may go up
and down.</p>
<p>Over-the-Counter (OTC) refers to trades made outside the organised exchanges.
Brokers and dealers use a network of computers and telephones to determine
prices between two parties.</p>
<h3>What You Need To Start</h3>
<p>To start investing, you will need:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>A Central Depository (CDP) account to hold your securities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A brokerage account with a securities broker for trading</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Not all products in a specific asset class are of the same quality.</p>
<p>For example, although bonds are often described as "safer", there are
differing quality of bonds out there. Some are rated as investment grade
while others are of lower quality (i.e. junk bonds or "high-yield" bonds).</p>
<p>Same goes for stocks too!</p>
<h3>Other Investment Products</h3>
<p>Some products are more complex than others and have terms and features
that may be difficult to understand. These products are classified as Specified
Investment Products (SIPs) in Singapore.</p>
<p>Before an SIP can be sold to you, financial institutions are required
to assess your investment knowledge and experience to make sure you can
understand these products.</p>
<p>This is done through a Customer Account Review (CAR) if you wish to open
an account to trade SIPs listed on an exchange, or a Customer Knowledge
Assessment (CKA) if you wish to invest in an unlisted SIPs.</p>
<p><strong>Note: Remember, do not invest in products you do not fully understand.</strong>
