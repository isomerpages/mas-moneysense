into this account. It serves as safe keeping of your stocks and securities
you have purchased.</p>
<p>This account also provides integrated clearing, settlement and depository
functions for account holders.</p>

<h3>How To Open A CDP Account</h3>
<p>Before opening a CDP account, you must ensure that you fulfill certain
eligibility criteria:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Have a savings or current bank account with one of the following banks:
Citibank, DBS/ POSB, HSBC, Maybank, OCBC, Standard Chartered Bank, UOB</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be 18 years old and above</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are <u>not</u> an un-discharged bankrupt</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When you are signing up <a href="https://investors.sgx.com/cdp-account-opening/#/form-selection" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">online</a>,
you will need to provide:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>A&nbsp;soft copy of either your Identity Card or passport, or 11B and
passport [for NSF]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any of the following; dated within the last three months:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Bank statement from any of the MAS licensed banks;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Central Provident Fund (CPF) statement; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Latest Notice of Assessment of your personal income tax.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Receiving Dividend Payments And Cash Entitlements</h3>
<p>CDP credits dividend payments or other cash distributions directly into
your designated bank account.</p>
<p>You need to set up your designated bank account if you want to receive
your dividends or cash distributions on schedule. Otherwise, these amounts
will be reflected in your CDP statements but the funds will not reach you.</p>
<p>You can set up your designated bank account by:</p>
<p>1. Calling 6535 7511<strong> </strong>(Select your language option, then
Option 5)</p>
<p>You will need:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Identification number &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CDP account number &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bank account number</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>2. Visiting SGX Investor Portal</p>
<p>You will need:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>CDP Internet account</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bank account number</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Dividends or cash distributions in foreign currencies will be automatically
converted to SGD before they are credited to you.</p>
<h3>How Can I Start Trading?</h3>
<p>Once you have set up an account with your preferred securities broking
firm, they will link up your trading account to your CDP account. Once
your trading account has been successfully linked (which may take up to
two weeks), you will be able to start trading.</p>
<h4>Customer Account Review (CAR) And Customer Knowledge Assessment (CKA)</h4>
<p>Specified Investment Products (SIPs) are complex investment products.
If you wish to trade in listed SIPs, your securities broking firm has to
conduct a Customer Account Review (CAR) to ascertain whether you have the
relevant knowledge or experience to understand the risks and features of
such complex product structures or derivatives before you are allowed to
trade.</p>
<p>For trading in unlisted SIPs, you are required to pass the Customer Knowledge
Assessment (CKA). This assessment is a requirement by Monetary Authority
of Singapore (MAS) for you to have the relevant knowledge or experience
to understand the risks and features of the unlisted SIPs. Your securities
broking firm will require you to produce your CKA assessment results.</p>
<p>&nbsp;MAS has put in these measures to protect you and safeguard your
interests. Find out more on CKA at the <a href="https://sips.abs.org.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">ABS</a>&nbsp;website.</p>
<p><strong>Remember, do not invest in products that you do not understand.</strong>
