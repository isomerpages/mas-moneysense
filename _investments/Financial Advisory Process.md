<p><strong>Getting financial advice begins with a fact-finding process and an analysis of your needs. Find out what the Financial Advisory (FA) representative needs to do and what you can expect when you meet.</strong>
</p>
<h4><strong>Key Takeaways</strong></h4>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Recommendations are based on what you disclose. So, be truthful about your financial situation and any medical conditions.</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Know your goals, how much you can afford to spend and how much risk or loss you can take.</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>If the recommendation does not feel right, you do not have to buy it.</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>What The FA Representative Needs To Do</strong></h2>
<p>When you are meeting an FA representative for the first time, they will
introduce themselves, the company they represent and the products they
can sell you.</p>
<p>After which, they will go through these steps:</p>
<h3><strong>1. Assess Your Financial Situation And Needs</strong></h3>
<p>Your FA representative will ask you a series of questions about your finances,
needs and goals. They need to gather enough information to assess your
financial situation, protection needs and investment objectives. This fact-finding
process is called <strong>Financial Needs Analysis</strong> (FNA).</p>
<p>As part of the FNA, your FA representative must identify your financial
objectives and risk tolerance through an FNA. They will also need to know
your employment status, financial situation (including your assets, liabilities,
cash flow and income), and current investment portfolio, including any
life policy.</p>
<p>If you are considering buying a life insurance policy, your FA representative
will also need the details of your dependents, as well as the extent, and
duration of financial support for each dependent.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you are dealing with a digital advisory service,
where there is no human intervention, you may not need to provide all the
information described above.</p>
<h4><strong>For Specified Investment Products</strong></h4>
<p>Your FA representative will also assess if you have the relevant knowledge
and experience to buy (or trade) a <a href="https://team.dms.mas.gov.sg/sites/csi/consEdn/MoneySense%20Website/MS%202023%20Website%20Archive/Offline%20Website/MON-241-PRD/www.moneysense.gov.sg/articles/2018/11/understanding-specified-investment-products-sips.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Specified Investment Product (SIP)</a>,
as you may be recommended such a product.</p>
<h3><strong>Note</strong></h3>
<p>If your FA representative finds that there are no financial gaps to be
addressed, they may not recommend a product to you at this point.</p>
<h3><strong>2. Make A Recommendation</strong></h3>
<p>Your FA representative must have a reasonable basis for their recommendation.
They must take into account your financial situation, particular needs
and investment objectives.</p>
<p>They must explain why the financial plan or product recommended is suitable
for you and disclose information on the product such as the benefits and
risks of the product, the premiums and charges that you need to pay, and
implications of any early withdrawal or surrenders.</p>
<p>Your FA representative will not recommend a <a href="https://team.dms.mas.gov.sg/sites/csi/consEdn/MoneySense%20Website/MS%202023%20Website%20Archive/Offline%20Website/MON-241-PRD/www.moneysense.gov.sg/articles/2018/11/understanding-specified-investment-products-sips.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">SIP</a> if
you are assessed to have not met the Customer Knowledge Assessment (for
unlisted SIPs) or Customer Account Review (for listed SIPs). However, if
you are interested in buying such a product although it was not recommended,
you will be responsible for ensuring the suitability of the product.</p>
<h3><strong>3. Provide All Documents Needed</strong></h3>
<p>Your FA representative must give you the full details of the products
that he or she is recommending. You should receive the following documents:</p>
<h4><strong>For Insurance</strong></h4>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Documentation of the FNA</strong> – Contains the information you
shared with your FA representative and the basis of the recommendation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cover page</strong> – A document highlighting the key information
from the policy illustration and the product summary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Product summary</strong> – An overview of the features, exclusions,
limitations, fees and charges of the recommended product.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Product highlights</strong> – For Investment-linked insurance policies
(ILPs). It describes the key features and risks of the relevant ILP sub-fund.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Policy illustration</strong> – Provides the benefits or projected
amounts payable in a claim or early termination of the policy. Including
total cash values and death benefits, premiums and cost of distribution
and charges. Cost of distribution includes the commission the insurer pays
to your FA representative or agent. The illustrations are projections,
and you may not actually get the returns set out.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Bundled product disclosure document</strong> – For bundled insurance
products. It sets out the principal features of the bundled product and
contrasts against the most comparable term life insurance product. Consumers
can consider buying, at lower cost, a term life product for insurance protection,
and investing the difference in premiums on their own.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Other documents</strong> – A copy of <a href="https://www.lia.org.sg/media/1389/ygtli_english_jul2018.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Your Guide to Life Insurance</a> and
a checklist to confirm that you have received and read the relevant documents.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>For Investments</h4>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Documentation of the FNA</strong> – Similar to FNA for insurance
products.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Product information</strong> – FIs are required to disclose the
features, risks, and costs of investment products to you. Depending on
the product you are considering to invest in, you may receive documents
such as a prospectus or product highlights sheet.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>4. Review Your Policy</strong></h3>
<p>Your FA representative should contact you to review your policy or your
investment portfolio with you regularly in order to help you see if your
needs are being met.</p>
<p>If your objectives, personal or financial circumstances have changed,
e.g. you have difficulty keeping up with your premium payments, you should
approach your FA representative for advice.</p>
<h2><strong>What You Should Do</strong></h2>
<p>Your financial information will help your FA representative recommend
a suitable product.</p>
<p>Without accurate and complete information, your FA representative may
not be able to fully assess your financial situation and needs. If you
are not comfortable to provide your details, ask them how this will affect
the recommendation.</p>
<h4>When you meet your FA representative</h4>
<p>At the first meeting, ask the FA representative to provide you with:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Their name</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Name of the company they represent</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Type of financial advisory service that they are authorised to provide</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Type of investment or insurance products they are authorised to provide
advice on</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Use the <a href="https://eservices.mas.gov.sg/rr" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Register of Representatives</a> and
<a href="https://eservices.mas.gov.sg/fid" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Financial Institutions Directory</a>to check if the FA representative
and the company are authorised to provide financial advisory services.</p>
<h4>While going through an FNA</h4>
<p><strong>Do:</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Provide complete and accurate information.</strong> Be clear about
your goals and risk tolerance. Fully and accurately disclose any pre-existing
medical conditions you may have.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Understand what you are buying.</strong> Do not rush into buying
on the spot. Take time to understand the recommendation, how it addresses
your needs and the financial commitments required of you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Ask questions.</strong> Prepare your questions in advance (or use
the checklists below).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Check all information before signing.</strong> Make sure your personal
details, e.g. education level, income, language proficiency, and risk profile
are accurate.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Don't:</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Feel obligated to sign or buy anything on the spot. If you are not sure
of the recommendation, take time to think about it. If necessary, discuss
it with your family and friends first.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lose sight of your financial goals and the reasons why you want to <a href="https://team.dms.mas.gov.sg/sites/csi/consEdn/MoneySense%20Website/MS%202023%20Website%20Archive/Offline%20Website/MON-241-PRD/www.moneysense.gov.sg/articles/2018/10/assessing-your-insurance-needs.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">buy insurance</a> or
<a href="https://team.dms.mas.gov.sg/sites/csi/consEdn/MoneySense%20Website/MS%202023%20Website%20Archive/Offline%20Website/MON-241-PRD/www.moneysense.gov.sg/articles/2018/11/financial-goals-at-different-life-stages.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">invest</a>in the first place.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Reviewing The Recommendation</h4>
<p>You should discuss the recommendation with your FA representative and
assess if it meets your needs. If you are not happy, you may ask them to
show you something else. Do not feel compelled to buy the product, even
if there is a 14-day free-look period for some products.</p>
<p><strong>If you disagree with the recommendation</strong>, tell your FA
representative what you really need. For example, if you want protection
coverage and not investment, be clear about this. Otherwise, you may end
up paying for something you do not need or want. Do ask for other recommendations.</p>
<p>If you decide not to take up their offer and choose to buy a different
product, it is your responsibility to check if the product you selected
suits you.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>After Buying Insurance Or Investing</h4>
<p><strong>If you change your mind,</strong> remember that you should do so
within the <strong>free-look period</strong>. You can go back to the product
provider to inform them. The free-look period enables you to cancel your
policy for any reason.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Insurance: 14 days from the date you receive your policy documents</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Investment: 7 days from the point of investment</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Pay your insurance premiums on time</strong> to prevent a policy
lapse.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Review your policy when your circumstances change</strong>, e.g.
if you are having another child. You can go back to your FA representative
for advice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Review your portfolio regularly</strong> – if your objectives are
not being met, you may want to save more or invest more whether through
other financial products or the current product.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Checklists</strong></h2>
<p>Be prepared when you meet your FA representative. Use these checklists
to go through what to do and ask before, during and after your meeting.</p>
<h4>Meeting Your FA Rep</h4>
<p><strong>Think about your financial goals and needs</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Ensure your family is financially sufficient in the event of unforeseen
events up until your youngest child can start work (protection need)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Protect your income if you are injured or fall ill (protection need)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Save for your child’s university education (savings goal)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Retire by a certain age (savings goal)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>(If you want to invest and build savings) Ask yourself how much risk you are prepared to and can afford to take</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Is it important that you do not lose any of the money you invested?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can you afford to lose some of, if not all the money, even if the product
offers higher returns?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When would you need the money that you are planning to save or invest?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Gather your personal details</strong>
</p>
<p>You will most likely be asked for:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Your income, borrowings and savings and cashflow</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any insurance policies or other financial products that you already have</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Details of your partner, children and any other dependents (e.g. age at
which they are no longer dependent on you)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>What To Do During Your Meeting</h4>
<p>It is essential to understand what is discussed during your meeting with
your FA representative. Use this checklist to help you.</p>
<p><strong>Take notes of what is said –</strong> This is so you do not have
to rely on your memory later.</p>
<p><strong>Ask about anything that you do not understand</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Check through the information to make sure what you have provided has
been accurately documented.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You should be comfortable that your ability to afford the product or take
risks is not over-stated.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Ask for the basis of recommendation and any explanation of the product in writing</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The proposal must state why the product is suitable for you. This will
help minimise any misunderstanding between you and your FA representative.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It will also be useful when you review your financial plans for the future.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Ask what you can do if you are not satisfied with the product</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Is there is a free-look or cancellation period? If so, find out the period
within which you can cancel your purchase.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ask about the procedures for doing so, costs involved, and terms and conditions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Do not be pressured into signing up on the spot –</strong> Do not
sign anything unless you have read and understood the document.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>NOTE: </strong>Your FA representative will assess your financial
situation and recommend products based on what you provide. So, make sure
the information you give is full and accurate.</p>
<h4>What To Do After Your Meeting</h4>
<p><strong>Check and keep all records</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Make sure the documents reflect your financial situation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Read the completed FNA and contact your advisor if there are any inconsistencies,
or if you have further questions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consider the recommendation carefully and whether it suits your needs.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Track your investment and review your needs</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The FNA only provides reviews of your financial needs at one point in
time. Your financial situation can change. For example, when you get married,
have a child, or there is a change in your income.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is essential that the financial products continue to meet your needs.
So, review your financial situation regularly to take these changes into
consideration.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pay your insurance premiums on time –</strong> Otherwise, your
policy may lapse.</p>
