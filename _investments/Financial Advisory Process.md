<h2><strong>What The FA Representative Needs To Do</strong></h2>
<p>When you are meeting an FA representative for the first time, they will
introduce themselves, the company they represent and the products they
can sell you.</p>
<p>After which, they will go through these steps:</p>
<h3><strong>1. Assess Your Financial Situation And Needs</strong></h3>
<p>Your FA representative will ask you a series of questions about your finances,
needs and goals. They need to gather enough information to assess your
financial situation, protection needs and investment objectives. This fact-finding
process is called <strong>Financial Needs Analysis</strong> (FNA).</p>
<p>As part of the FNA, your FA representative must identify your financial
objectives and risk tolerance through an FNA. They will also need to know
your employment status, financial situation (including your assets, liabilities,
cash flow and income), and current investment portfolio, including any
life policy.</p>
<p>If you are considering buying a life insurance policy, your FA representative
will also need the details of your dependents, as well as the extent, and
duration of financial support for each dependent.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you are dealing with a digital advisory service,
where there is no human intervention, you may not need to provide all the
information described above.</p>
<h4><strong>For Specified Investment Products</strong></h4>
<p>Your FA representative will also assess if you have the relevant knowledge
and experience to buy (or trade) a <a href="https://team.dms.mas.gov.sg/sites/csi/consEdn/MoneySense%20Website/MS%202023%20Website%20Archive/Offline%20Website/MON-241-PRD/www.moneysense.gov.sg/articles/2018/11/understanding-specified-investment-products-sips.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Specified Investment Product (SIP)</a>,
as you may be recommended such a product.</p>
<h3><strong>Note</strong></h3>
<p>If your FA representative finds that there are no financial gaps to be
addressed, they may not recommend a product to you at this point.</p>
<h3><strong>2. Make A Recommendation</strong></h3>
<p>Your FA representative must have a reasonable basis for their recommendation.
They must take into account your financial situation, particular needs
and investment objectives.</p>
<p>They must explain why the financial plan or product recommended is suitable
for you and disclose information on the product such as the benefits and
risks of the product, the premiums and charges that you need to pay, and
implications of any early withdrawal or surrenders.</p>
<p>Your FA representative will not recommend a <a href="https://team.dms.mas.gov.sg/sites/csi/consEdn/MoneySense%20Website/MS%202023%20Website%20Archive/Offline%20Website/MON-241-PRD/www.moneysense.gov.sg/articles/2018/11/understanding-specified-investment-products-sips.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">SIP</a> if
you are assessed to have not met the Customer Knowledge Assessment (for
unlisted SIPs) or Customer Account Review (for listed SIPs). However, if
you are interested in buying such a product although it was not recommended,
you will be responsible for ensuring the suitability of the product.</p>
<h3><strong>3. Provide All Documents Needed</strong></h3>
<p>Your FA representative must give you the full details of the products
that he or she is recommending. You should receive the following documents:</p>
<h4><strong>For Insurance</strong></h4>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Documentation of the FNA</strong> – Contains the information you
shared with your FA representative and the basis of the recommendation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cover page</strong> – A document highlighting the key information
from the policy illustration and the product summary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Product summary</strong> – An overview of the features, exclusions,
limitations, fees and charges of the recommended product.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Product highlights</strong> – For Investment-linked insurance policies
(ILPs). It describes the key features and risks of the relevant ILP sub-fund.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Policy illustration</strong> – Provides the benefits or projected
amounts payable in a claim or early termination of the policy. Including
total cash values and death benefits, premiums and cost of distribution
and charges. Cost of distribution includes the commission the insurer pays
to your FA representative or agent. The illustrations are projections,
and you may not actually get the returns set out.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Bundled product disclosure document</strong> – For bundled insurance
products. It sets out the principal features of the bundled product and
contrasts against the most comparable term life insurance product. Consumers
can consider buying, at lower cost, a term life product for insurance protection,
and investing the difference in premiums on their own.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Other documents</strong> – A copy of <a href="https://www.lia.org.sg/media/1389/ygtli_english_jul2018.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Your Guide to Life Insurance</a> and
a checklist to confirm that you have received and read the relevant documents.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>For Investments</h4>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Documentation of the FNA</strong> – Similar to FNA for insurance
products.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Product information</strong> – FIs are required to disclose the
features, risks, and costs of investment products to you. Depending on
the product you are considering to invest in, you may receive documents
such as a prospectus or product highlights sheet.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>4. Review Your Policy</strong></h3>
<p>Your FA representative should contact you to review your policy or your
investment portfolio with you regularly in order to help you see if your
needs are being met.</p>
<p>If your objectives, personal or financial circumstances have changed,
e.g. you have difficulty keeping up with your premium payments, you should
approach your FA representative for advice.</p>
<h2><strong>What You Should Do</strong></h2>
<p>Your financial information will help your FA representative recommend
a suitable product.</p>
<p>Without accurate and complete information, your FA representative may
not be able to fully assess your financial situation and needs. If you
are not comfortable to provide your details, ask them how this will affect
the recommendation.</p>
<p>When you meet your FA representative</p>
<p>While going through an FNA</p>
<p>Reviewing the recommendation</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>After buying insurance or investing</p>
<h2><strong>Checklists</strong></h2>
<p>Be prepared when you meet your FA representative. Use these checklists
to go through what to do and ask before, during and after your meeting.</p>
