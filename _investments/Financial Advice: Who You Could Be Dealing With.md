<h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Make sure your financial advisor and FA representative are authorised
to provide financial advice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Learn about the different types of financial advisers</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>What Is Financial Advice?</h3>
<p>Financial advice is given when someone looks into your needs and financial
situation and recommends you to purchase an investment or life insurance
product.</p>
<h3>When To Seek Advice</h3>
<p>You may want to seek financial advice when you have a financial need or
goal but do not know how to address it. Only authorised firms and individuals
are allowed to give you financial advice on investments and life insurance
products.</p>
<p>As part of assessing your financial situation and needs, the Financial
Advisory (FA) representative will help you identify specific goals and
develop a plan to achieve them over time. The plan may include buying life
insurance or investment products.</p>
<h3>Buying A Product With And Without Advice</h3>
<p>If you choose to receive financial advice, your FA representative must
ensure that the product recommended is suitable for your needs, taking
into account your financial objectives, investment horizon, risk profile
and other relevant circumstances.</p>
<p>If you choose to buy without advice, you will need to ensure for yourself
that the product you select is suitable for your needs.</p>
<p>For example, before you buy, you would have to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Calculate the amount of insurance coverage you need</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Decide on the length of coverage needed, e.g. until your children are
independent</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Work out your budget to see if you can afford the premiums throughout
the life of the contract</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Who Can Give Financial Advice</h3>
<p>Only authorised firms and individuals are allowed to give you financial
advice.</p>
<p>FA representatives are appointed by licensed financial advisors, banks,
insurance companies or brokerages to provide advice on life insurance and
investment products on their behalf.</p>
<p>They may call themselves <strong>financial advisors, financial planners, financial consultants, insurance agents or relationship managers.</strong> Regardless,
individuals authorised to provide financial advice will be issued a unique
representative number by the Monetary Authority of Singapore.</p>
<p>Always ask for the FA representative's unique representative number and
check if he or she is permitted to give financial advice.</p>
<p>Always check the following:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><a href="https://eservices.mas.gov.sg/fid" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Financial Institutions Directory</a> to
see if the FA firm is authorised by MAS to provide financial advisory services</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://eservices.mas.gov.sg/rr" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Register of Representatives</a> to
see if the individual you are talking to is an FA representative</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Types Of Financial Advisors</h3>
<p>There are different types of financial institutions that can offer financial
advice on investments and life insurance products. They could be licensed
financial advisory firms, banks, insurance companies, insurance brokers
or brokerages.</p>
<p>Each has different business models and structures. Some have commercial
arrangements or ownership links with product providers, some do not. It
is important to understand the differences and decide which firm best suits
your needs.</p>
<h3>Check With Your FA Representative</h3>
<p>Ask your FA representative whether the financial advisor he or she represents
is confined to selling products of a restricted range of product providers.</p>
<p>Examples would be:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Certain tie-ups where banks partner specific product providers to distribute
their products</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Instances where the FA representative is a tied agent of an insurer and
only offers the products of that insurer</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Independent Financial Advisors</h3>
<p>You may meet financial advisors that promote or advertise their services
as being independent. What this generally means is that the firm has no
financial or commercial links with product providers.</p>
<p>The firm must:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Not receive any commercial benefits from a product provider which may
create product bias</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be free from any restriction relating to any investment product which
is recommended</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be free from any conflict of interest created by any connection or association
with any product provider</p>
</li>
</ul>
