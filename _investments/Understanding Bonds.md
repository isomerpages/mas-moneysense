<p><strong>Understand how bonds work and the things to look out for if you are thinking of investing in them.</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>When you invest in bonds, you are lending money to the bond issuer at an agreed interest rate for a set period of time.</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>You can expect to be repaid the principal amount when the bond matures, provided that the bond issuer does not default.</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>When interest rates rise, you will likely see a fall in bond prices, and vice versa.</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>What it is</strong></h2>
<p>A bond is a debt security. It is a form of borrowing. Governments and
companies issue bonds to raise funds (borrow money). When you invest in
bonds, you are lending money to the issuer for a fixed period of time.</p>
<h2><strong>How it works</strong></h2>
<p>Most bonds pay a regular stream of income throughout their life, also
known as a coupon. Coupon rates are typically expressed as a percentage
of the principal amount, which is also known as the “face” or “par” value.
Upon maturity, the bonds are redeemed and you are paid back the face or
par value.</p>
<p>Typically, you can earn returns through:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Interest income. These are the coupon payments you receive as an investor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Capital gains. You can earn capital gains if you sell the bonds at a higher
price than the price you bought them at.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It is important to note that while the coupon rate is generally fixed
through the life of the bond, the price of the bond may vary.</p>
<p>Hence, in deriving a bond’s return, you will have to consider:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The coupon that you will receive over the life of the bond</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The potential capital gains or losses if the price of the bond becomes
higher or lower than the price you initially paid</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Are bonds suitable for you?</strong></h2>
<p>Bonds may be attractive for investors who desire a source of regular income,
or are looking to diversify their portfolio of investment assets.
<br>
<br>You should consider the suitability of an investment in bonds in light
of your own circumstances. In particular, you should consider whether you:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Understand thoroughly the terms and conditions of the bonds</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are able to evaluate the investment in the bonds and how such investment
will impact your overall investment portfolio</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have sufficient financial resources and liquidity to bear all the risks
of investing in the bonds or holding the bonds to maturity, including losing
all or a substantial amount of the capital invested</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are able to monitor or evaluate (either by yourself or with the help of
a financial adviser) changes in economic or other factors that may affect
the issuer or the bonds</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Why bonds have different coupon rates</strong></h2>
<p>The coupon rates for different bonds will vary based on the credit quality
of the issuer and the credit rating.</p>
<p><strong>Credit quality of the issuer</strong>
</p>
<p>Issuers with lower credit quality generally pay higher coupon rates on
their bonds. This is because when an issuer has a lower credit quality,
there is a greater probability of default. Such issuers typically issue
bonds with higher coupon rates in order to compensate investors for the
higher risks.</p>
<p>Study carefully the credit risk of the issuer to see whether you have
the risk appetite to invest in its bonds. You can assess the credit risk
of the issuer through its credit ratings or by using credit metrics.</p>
<p><strong>Credit ratings</strong>
</p>
<p>Borrowers and the bonds they issue are often assigned a credit rating.
There could be a separate rating for the company or country issuing bonds
and another rating for the bonds themselves.</p>
<p>So, the issuer rating and the bond rating are not necessarily the same.</p>
<p>Credit ratings are an indication of the credit worthiness of a bond issuer
with respect to its bond obligations. The table below illustrates the different
bond rating scales from the major rating agencies, Moody's, Standard &amp;
Poor's (S&amp;P) and Fitch.</p>

<p>All ratings fall into two large categories known as investment and non-investment
grade.</p>
<p><strong>Non-investment grade bonds</strong>
</p>
<p>Non-investment grade bonds are also commonly known as junk bonds or high
yield bonds. They offer a much higher yield to compensate for the higher
probability of default. In effect, bonds are not always low risk; some
may be riskier than stocks.</p>
<p><strong>Unrated bonds</strong>
</p>
<p>Not all bonds are rated by international or major rating agencies. Some
bond issuers may not seek a credit rating. For example, if the issuer feels
that their target investor markets are sufficiently familiar with them
and may even regard them as being more creditworthy than a credit rating
may have suggested.</p>
<p>For the same reason, smaller and less frequent issuers may also not want
to bear the cost of rating fees if the bonds are meant for a domestic market
that already knows them.</p>
<p>For such unrated issuers and bonds, you should consider other measures
of the issuer’s creditworthiness and the characteristics of the bonds when
deciding whether to invest in the issuer’s bonds.</p>
<h2><strong>What to consider before investing</strong></h2>
<p>Credit ratings have their limitations and should not be your sole consideration
when deciding whether a bond should be included in your investment portfolio.</p>
<p>They are only statements of opinion by the relevant credit rating agency
and are not recommendations to invest. Furthermore, as the ratings are
based on information available at the time the rating is assigned, they
are subject to revision or withdrawal.</p>
<p>As an issuers’ credit worthiness can change quickly, there is no assurance
that any revisions to the ratings will be made in a timely manner. You
should find out more about the issuer, profitability of the business and
track record of prior bond issues, if any. This will help you to examine
if the company is able to meet its debt obligations, including the bond
you may be considering.</p>
<p>One way is to look at the company’s solvency ratios such as interest coverage
ratios and other credit metrics.</p>
<p><strong>Credit metrics</strong>
</p>
<p>Some useful financial credit metrics that you could look out for are:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Debt to equity ratio –</strong> Measures how much debt an issuer
is using to finance its assets and operations, as compared with the issuer’s
equity. A high level of debt suggests higher risk. If debt to equity ratio
is more than 2, it means that to finance its operations, the issuer has
more than twice the amount of debt compared with equity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Debt to operating income ratio –</strong> Indicates the ability
of a company to pay its debt using operating income. A higher ratio suggests
that the company may have more difficulty servicing its debt. A declining
ratio is better than an increasing one because it implies the company is
paying off its debt and/or growing earnings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Interest coverage ratio –</strong> Reflects how many times the
issuer can pay interest on debt obligations, using its operating income
(or earnings). A lower interest coverage ratio means a weaker ability to
cover interest obligations using its operating income. If the ratio is
less than 1, it means that the issuer does not earn enough to cover its
interest expense.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Operating profit margin –</strong> Measures operating profit (or
operating income) as a percentage of revenue. This shows the proportion
of revenue left, after the issuer pays for operating expenses (such as
wages), which can be used to pay for fixed costs (such as interest). The
lower the operating profit margin, the higher the risk of the issuer not
being able to pay its fixed costs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Free cash flow –</strong> The cash that a company has after spending
money to maintain or expand its assets. An issuer with a profitable and
well-managed business should exhibit positive free cash flows consistently.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You should compare the credit metrics of an issuer with that of other
similar entities, as financial ratios vary across industries.</p>
<p><strong>Tenure of the bond</strong>
</p>
<p>Bonds from the same issuer with longer tenures tend to provide higher
coupon rates than bonds with lower tenures. This is to compensate the investors
for holding the bonds for a longer period of time as the chance of default
rises with the duration of the bond.
<br>
<br>Callable bonds have a feature which gives the issuer an option to buy
back (redeem) the bond before its maturity date. The issuer may specify
a price at which it will call (or redeem) the bonds. If a bond is called
when prevailing interest rates are lower than at the time you bought it,
you will be exposed to reinvestment risks.</p>
<p><strong>Government bonds versus corporate bonds</strong>
</p>
<p>For any particular country, the safest and highest credit quality bonds
are usually its government bonds, followed by quasi-government or government
linked entities, banks and then companies.</p>
<p>If you are interested in the safety of your bond investments, you should
consider <strong>government or investment grade corporate bonds,</strong> while
investors willing and able to accept a higher level of risk could consider
lower credit-quality or non-rated bonds.
<br>
<br>It is also advisable to diversify and avoid concentrated exposures to
any one security. Individual investments can go up or down in value. Investing
in different products is usually a good strategy to diversify and reduce
the risks.</p>
<h2><strong>What is the most you can lose?</strong></h2>
<p>You may lose a part of your invested amount if you sell your bonds before
it matures. Bond prices fluctuate depending on the perceived credit quality
of the issuer and market conditions. However, you may lose all of your
investment if the issuer defaults on its bond or winds up or is liquidated.</p>
<h2><strong>What are the risks?</strong></h2>
<p>Common risks associated with bonds include the following:</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The terms and conditions for different bonds can
differ greatly. Always read and understand the terms carefully before investing
in any bonds.</p>
<h2><strong>When a bond defaults</strong></h2>
<p>An “event of default” could happen when an issuer:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Fails to pay interest or principal on the payment due date</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fails to observe financial covenants, such as ensuring that the net borrowings
to total equity does not exceed a certain ratio</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The issuer will define the “events of default” in the terms and conditions
of the bond which should be disclosed in the offer document given to you.
When a default happens, you may lose all or a substantial part of your
investment.</p>

</p>
<h2><strong>Buying a bond</strong></h2>
<p>You can buy a bond at issuance, through a public offer. You will pay the
face value of the bond.</p>
<p>You can also buy a bond on the secondary market (after issuance), as long
as there is a seller for it. This can be done through the <a href="http://www.sgx.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Singapore Exchange (SGX)</a>.</p>
<p>If you buy on the secondary market, the price you pay for the bond depends
on the prevailing market price. You will also need to pay transaction fees,
such as brokerage fees.</p>

</p>
<h2><strong>Selling a bond</strong></h2>
<p>You can hold the bond to maturity. You can expect to be repaid the principal
amount of the bond at maturity provided that the bond issuer does not default.
<br>
<br>Before the bond matures, you can sell the bond in the secondary market,
as long as there is a buyer for it. The price you get depends on the prevailing
price at the time of sale.</p>
<p>If you sell the bond at a price higher than what you paid, you can make
a capital gain. Likewise, you could also suffer a loss if you sell at a
lower price.</p>
<h2><strong>Types of bonds</strong></h2>
<p>Here are some examples of bond investments available in Singapore.</p>
<p><strong>Singapore Government Securities and Savings Bonds</strong>
</p>
<p>In Singapore, you can choose from <a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/bonds-and-bills/Singapore-Government-Bonds-Information-for-Individuals" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Singapore Government Securities (SGS)</a> and
<a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/bonds-and-bills/Singapore-Savings-Bonds" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Singapore Savings Bonds (SSBs)</a>. These are backed by the Singapore
Government and considered risk-free investments.</p>
<p>Savings Bonds are designed specifically for retail investors as a flexible,
low-cost and low-risk savings product.</p>
<p>The key differences are as follows:</p>

<p><strong>Corporate bonds</strong>
</p>
<p>Corporate bonds are issued by companies. They usually pay out higher interest
rates than government bonds because they generally carry more risk.</p>
<p>You can buy corporate bonds listed on SGX in the same way as you would
buy shares, paying the normal brokerage fees.</p>
<p>Advantages:</p>

<p>Bond ETFs typically aim to track the performance of bond indices. They
may invest in a portfolio of bonds, or replicate that exposure through
the use of derivative products like swaps. Different bond ETFs may adopt
varying strategies</p>
<p>Advantages:</p>
